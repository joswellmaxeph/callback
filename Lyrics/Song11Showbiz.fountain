PHYLLIS
~We toil at the mercy of this merciless machine
~The almighty dollar, the all-holy green
~Creating "content" for a four point five inch screen
~With an aspect ratio of nine by sixteen
~All these poor saps come to L.A. to chase their dreams
~They pour their hearts out on the stage just to be seen
~But if the market finds no value in them to redeem

The lights go out when the music goes out. Phyllis changes into a glamourous costume with a sparkly top hat.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~We crush their aspirations into smithereens
~That's showbiz

When the bass drops, a strobe starts. Phyllis does jazz hands and other dramatic showy gestures.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~That's showbiz
~All I know is
~That's showbiz

Back to a sort of normal stage.

JESSE
~I moved here thinking I would find my perfect niche
~This job's alright, but it doesn't scratch that itch
~I'm not fulfilled, but I guess that I'm content
~It's not my calling, but I've gotta pay the rent

PHYLLIS
~That's showbiz

EVERETT
~Some think I only care about the bottom line
~But I'm just trying to keep this company alive
~If we want to keep making shows, our business has to thrive
~If we don't make money, we don't survive

The strobe is back.

ENSEMBLE
~That's showbiz
~That's showbiz
~All I know is
~That's showbiz

Additional lights flash on the stage.

ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)

PHYLLIS
~They turned comedy
~Into a commodity

ENSEMBLE

PHYLLIS
~I don't think it oughta be
~But it isn't up to me

ENSEMBLE
~All I know is

PHYLLIS
~Art is more than just a byproduct of corporatry

ENSEMBLE

PHYLLIS
~Someone save me from this industry!

ENSEMBLE
~That's showbiz
