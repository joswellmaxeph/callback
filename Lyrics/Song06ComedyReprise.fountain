SHAWN
~Comedy's a competition
~I guess I compete against myself
~But now I'm here at this audition
~Wishin' I could be somebody else
~I'm just trying to be
~A better version of me
~I have low self-esteem
~But I'm in therapy

~Oh, it's comedy
~Self-deprecating comedy
~Self-doubtulating comedy
~This is humiliating comedy

SHAWN (CONT'D)
~I'm not conventionally funny
~That's what they tell me all the time
~They also say I'm not conventionally attractive
~Which seems irrelevant but I guess it's fine
~I don't want to be conventional
~I want to be multi-dimensional
~I wanna get weirdly emotional
~And maybe start to cry
~Is this still...

SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Comedy?
~Yeah, it's just reprehensible comedy
~It's just inaccessible comedy
~Deeply personal comedy, you see

PHYLLIS
~Comedy's a competition
~For me, it's been reduced to nothing more
~I used to laugh with reckless abandon
~Now I'm taking notes and keeping score
~How I yearn to return
~To the way I was before
~When I'd L.O.L. and R.O.T.F.L.
~That stands for rolling on the floor
~Laughing at...

~Oh it's comedy
~To be alive with love and mirth
~I need comedy

~Your laughter's my self-worth
~Oh, comedy
