MEL
~Get a drink at the bar
~The bartender knows your order by heart

Casey hands an ice-cold Miller High Life to Shawn, who takes a sip.

MEL (CONT'D)
~Livin' the high life on Lorain Avenue
~Every weekend night and sometimes weeknights too

SHAWN
~It's pretty comfortable here
~Drinkin' the champagne of beers
~Warm smiles on all the faces you see
~But there's somewhere else you'd rather be

Shawn, Vic, Danny, and the other improvisers take the stage. Mel hops off.

ENSEMBLE
~Alt comedy theater
~In a mid-size rust-belt city
~Guaranteed at least a couple of laughs
~And only sometimes out of pity
~Alt comedy theater
~Sit back and enjoy the show
~It's an intimate audience experience
~You're probably here to see someone you know

DANNY
Okay, can I get a suggestion of something you WOULDN'T wear to the Prom?

KIERAN
Pineapple!

DANNY
Alright, I think heard "Chuck E. Cheese costume."

The performers start pantomiming an over-the-top improv scene.

KIERAN
~I'm a Level One improv student
~And I think this is really good

MEL
~I'm their Level Three improv teacher
~And they aren't sweeping scenes as quickly as they should!

CASEY
~I've seen so many shows that I don't even know
~How to tell what's good anymore
~Standup, improv, and sketch, must be funny, I guess
~If I hear them laughing through the door!

Casey runs off through the door back to the bar area.

ENSEMBLE
~Our stakes are low
~Our crowds are small
~We do our best
~And laugh through it all

DANNY
~Alt comedy theater
~In a mid-size rust belt city
~Everyone knows everyone
~Our community is itty bitty

SHAWN
~Alt comedy theater
~It's not the place you really wanna be
~If you long for something bigger
~If you're anything like me

ENSEMBLE
~Alt comedy theater
~All our best bits on display
~Here is where we live and we love, and
~We laugh our lives away

ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
~BLACKOUT!
