KIERAN
~Get a drink at the bar
~The bartender knows your order by heart

Casey hands an ice-cold Miller High Life to Shawn, who takes a sip.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
~Livin' the High Life on Lorain Avenue
~Every weekend night and sometimes weeknights too

Shawn jumps up on stage.

SHAWN
~I feel at home when I'm here
~Drinkin' the champagne of beers
~All my old friends smiling welcoming me
~And there's nowhere else I'd rather be

Every cast member gets up on stage.

ENSEMBLE
~Alt comedy theater
~In a mid-sized rust-belt city
~Guaranteed a whole boatload of laughs
~When you leave, you'll be feeling giddy
~Alt comedy theater
~We hope you enjoyed the show

DANNY
~And raise your hand if there's someone up here
~In the cast who you personally know

SHAWN
~Alt comedy theater
~The only place you really wanna be
~If you're anything, if you're anything
~If you're a-ny-thing like me!

DANNY
~Like me!

CASEY
~Like me!

ENSEMBLE
~Like me!

ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
