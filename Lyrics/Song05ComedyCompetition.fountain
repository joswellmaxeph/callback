ENSEMBLE
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition

VIC
~I was raised in this
~Watchin' *Whose Line* from birth
~You could search
~Every corner of the earth
~You won't find anybody
~Who's as funny as me
~Not in L.A., not in Chicago
~Not in N.Y.C.
~I'm puttin' C.L.E.
~On the M.A.P.
~All around the globe
~Three hundred sixty degrees
~Fahrenheit, I could scorch y'all
~With all this heat
~This is the roast of everybody
~And I'm the emcee

ENSEMBLE
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition

VIC
~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~I can make you laugh
~Even if you're anhedonic
~Just me on the mic
~But I still sound symphonic
~Orchestrating punchlines
~Like a joke philharmonic
~Words from every angle
~Like it's stereophonic
~When I say I'm laconic
~You know I'm being ironic
~I'm verbose and sardonic
~Make Einstein look moronic
~I am chronically iconic
~And quicker than supersonic
~Need a tonic, 'cause I'm an
~Iller killer than the bubonic
~Plague

Vic pauses, seemingly rethinking.

VIC (CONT'D)
~Maybe all of this is just a defense mechanism
~Maybe deep down inside I yearn for recognition
~Because my dad never loved me without condition
~Maybe that's the source of all of my ambition
~And maybe comedy could be more to me
~Like community instead of rivalry
~Maybe I should change my position

Vic's demeanor changes back to how it was before.

VIC (CONT'D)
~Just kiddin'
