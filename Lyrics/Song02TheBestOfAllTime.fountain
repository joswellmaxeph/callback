SHAWN
~I require
~Universal acclaim
~Unbelievable fortune
~And indescribable fame
~Stadiums full of people
~Cheering and chanting my name
~All around the world
~I want to hear them all proclaim
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time
~I don't want them to love me
~Unconditionally
~I want rigid conditions
~That I easily meet
~I want them to know me
~Complete and totally
~And seeing me entirely
~I want them to decree
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time
~I know that I am not deserving of their love
~But I'm pining for it every day
~And even though I know I'll never be enough
~I still hope someday they will say
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

Disembodied heads appear and join in the chorus.

ENSEMBLE
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

SHAWN
~Shawn, you're the best of all...
