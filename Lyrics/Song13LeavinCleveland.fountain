CASEY
~That's one thing about Cleveland
~Everybody's always leavin'
~Somewhere better to go
~Tryna get away from the snow
~It's hard to say goodbye
~Always feels a little like death
~I know you're still alive
~We're just gonna miss you after you've left
~You've gotta go spread your wings
~And fly from the midwest
~You've always been a fledgling
~Now it's time to be full-fledged
~That's one thing about Cleveland
~Everybody's always leavin'
~Somewhere better to go
~Tryna get away from the snow
~You've got big dreams to follow
~And I hope they all come true
~Just remember us when you're famous
~We won't forget about you
~Lookin' back on all the laughs
~Makes it harder to be movin' on
~You never know you're livin' in the good ol' days
~Until the good ol' days've come and gone
~That's one thing about Cleveland
~Everybody's always leavin'
~Somewhere better to go
~Tryna get away from the snow
