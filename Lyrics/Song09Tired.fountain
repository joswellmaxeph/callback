SHAWN
~I don't think I can do this
~I can't do this anymore
~How many times I've been through this
~What am I doing it for?
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~Existing is so exhausting
~Why do I have t be me?
~I don't know why I keep trying
~I'll never be who I want to be

TINA
~I understand what you're saying
~I'm tired all of the time
~But you're not really helping
~When you hold up my line

ENSEMBLE
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired

SHAWN
~I just want to be free from my own identity
