~Shawn, you have got
~To build some self-worth of your own
~I've been trying to help you
~But I can't do it alone
~No one else gives you your value
~You've gotta find it within
~So I'll just say this once
~And then I won't say it again
~Shawn, I adore you
~Shawn, I'd do anything for you
~Shawn, I would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time
