SHAWN
~Laugh a little more
~Louder than before
~Saddled by the weight of time progressing
~Every stupid moment is a blessing
~Funny 'cause it's true
~All there is to do
~In the face of existential nonsense
~Is to sop it up before it's gone and...
~Laugh and live and love
~All of the above
~Feel as deep as feelings can be feeling
~Feel it from the floor up to the ceiling
~Love and live and laugh
~Half and half and half
~Greater than the sum of each component
~Somewhere in the sum of every moment
~There's an experience he's desperate to explain
~It's more than one small dumb audition can contain
~It's everything, it's life, it's silly, it's profound
~In grave absurdity, there's meaning to be found
~Reaching out his hand
~Hopes they understand
~He is not expecting adulation
~All he really wants to do is make them...
~Laugh and maybe cry
~Both at the same time
~He has got to make it happen some way
~Also he's a mime and so he can't say
~Words
