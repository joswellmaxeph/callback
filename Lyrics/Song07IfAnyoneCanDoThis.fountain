DANNY
~I don't know what's gonna happen
~This could be a huge mistake
~But if you wanna live like you were meant to live
~It's a mistake you've gotta make
~There's something special inside you
~You've gotta give it all you've got to get it out
~You might not be sure that you're the one for this
~But me, I have no doubt
~Me, I have no doubt
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~It's you
~I don't know what's gonna happen
~But whatever does, you've gotta let it
~And if you have faith without expectation
~I know for sure you won't regret it
~You gotta show them exactly who you are
~I'm telling you, this is your time to shine
~You've gotta be vulnerable, if you wanna be the best
~You've gotta put yourself on the line
~You've gotta put yourself on the line
~I know you're scared
~But I know you're strong
~And I'll be right there
~With you all along
~I know it's hard
~What you've gotta do
~But believe me when I say
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you

ENSEMBLE
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you
~If anyone can do this it's you

DANNY
~It's you
