PHYLLIS
~Cleveland
~Give me something to believe in
~Something in which to believe
~Something hiding up your sleeve
~Save us from fiscal devastation
~Cleveland
~I need a superstar next season
~You can give me what I need
~I want so badly to succeed
~And Cleveland, you can be the reason
~I've gotta find
~A diamond in the rough
~Any neighborhood will do
~West Park, Tremont, or Hough
~They tell me that in Cleveland you
~Have got to be tough
~So I know there must be somewhere there
~Who's got the right stuff

ENSEMBLE
~In Cleveland
~Protect our service from deletion
~Quibi got it pretty quick
~And we know Seeso couldn't stick
~But maybe we can keep on streamin'
~If we go to Cleveland
~Even though we might be freezin'
~Amidst the potholes and the ice
~We'll find a Great Lakes paradise
~From which we'll pull our next sensation

JESSE
~We'll find someone hot
~Like a river on fire

PHYLLIS
~Someone to make the ladies laugh
~And all the boys perspire

JESSE
~Someone with pure midwestern charm

PHYLLIS
~And also cutting satire

JESSE
~Someone to take our lowly ratings
~And make them higher

PHYLLIS
~Not sure if I know
~Exactly why-oh
~But I know I-oh
~I just have to fly-oh
~Straight to Ohio
~And more specifically...
~Cleveland
~Give me someone to believe in
~Someone in whom to believe
~Someone hiding up your sleeve
~Save us from fiscal devastation

ENSEMBLE
~Oh, Cleveland
~We need a superstar next season
~You can give us what we need
~We want so badly to succeed
~And Cleveland, you can be the reason
~It's Cleveland
~And the Greater Cleveland region
~Gave us Big Chuck and Lil' John
~Travis Kelce and LeBron
~I just need one more great comedian
~I'm begging you
~Cleveland
~Best location in the nation

PHYLLIS
~You're my last and only shot
~Please tell me that you've got
~Someone to lead us to salvation
~Someone from Cleveland
