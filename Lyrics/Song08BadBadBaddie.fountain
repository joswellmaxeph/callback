~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm a villain
~I'm gonna do whatever it takes
~To stay winnin'
~I might do something nice
~But it's all just an act
~When you turn around
~You'll get stabbed in the back
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad
~Who's your daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I'm a cartoon villain
~Cruella De Vil
~Make a coat out of you
~On stage when I kill
~I'm so Divine
~I inspired a sea witch
~I'm Ursula, baby
~And I'm leavin' you speechless
~Call me a Captain
~'Cause you're gonna get hooked
~Maleficently
~You're about to get cooked
~Need a round of applause
~Make way for Jafar
~You're gonna get the claws
~If you're messin' with Scar
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad
~Dad daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I'm gonna be on top
~Get out of my way
~No one's gonna stop me
~From having my day
~I'll get what I want
~No matter the cost
~If you're up against me
~You've already lost
~I'll dupe and I'll con
~I'll trick and I'll cheat
~I'm not above treachery
~Fraud or deceit
~I'll beat anybody
~Do what I've gotta do
~Even if I
~Have to sabotage you
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad
~Who's your daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I refuse to lose
~Under any circumstance
~I'll eliminate each threat
~No one else will stand a chance
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~Oh, I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~I said who's your dad dad dad
~Who's your daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad
~Bad baddie
~Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha
