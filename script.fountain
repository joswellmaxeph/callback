int. comedy theater stage - night #1#

The stage is set up for a normal improv show. MEL (late 30s, flustered) takes the stage. SHAWN (mid 20s, bright-eyed), DANNY (early 30s, chill), VIC (early 20s, focused), CASEY (early 40s, tired), and KIERAN (late teens, excited) are standing in the audience area.

MEL
Good evening everybody! Thanks so much for coming out to our humble little theater on this beautiful Cleveland night. We have a great improv show coming up for you, but first, I have to go over some housekeeping items. Please silence your cell phones and refrain from flash photography (unless something really funny happens). Uh, make sure to clap and laugh if the show is good - actually you should do that even if you don't think it's good (it will make them feel better). You all know all this stuff. Bathrooms are to your left, and the bar is to your right.

**[SONG 1: ALT COMEDY THEATER]**

===

>_SONG 1: ALT COMEDY THEATER_<

Mel, the host of the show, stands on stage and addresses the audience. Shawn stands in front of the curtain by the lobby door (stage left), along with Casey - they should both be visible to the real audience. Vic and Danny are off-stage by the bathrooms (stage right). Kieran is "in the audience" at a table by the bathrooms (stage right).

!    MEL
~Get a drink at the bar
~The bartender knows your order by heart

Casey hands an ice-cold Miller High Life to Shawn, who raises the bottle. Mel looks over and acknowledges them.

!    MEL (CONT'D)
~Livin' the High Life on Lorain Avenue
~Every weekend night and sometimes weeknights too

Casey walks quickly to stage right by the bathrooms. Shawn steps in front of the stage. Mel mimes a continued speech introducing the improv group.

!    SHAWN
~It's pretty comfortable here
~Drinkin' the champagne of beers

Shawn begins to ascend the stage, followed by Vic and Danny. They put their beer down somewhere.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Warm smiles on all the faces you see
~But there's somewhere else you'd rather be

Kieran and Casey sing from the wings - Shawn, Vic, Danny, and Mel sing from the stage.

!    ENSEMBLE
~Alt comedy theater
~In a mid-size rust-belt city

!    MEL
~Guaranteed at least a couple of laughs
~And only sometimes out of pity

!    ENSEMBLE
~Alt comedy theater
~Sit back and enjoy the show

!    VIC
~It's an intimate audience experience
~You're probably here to see someone you know

DANNY
Okay, can I get a suggestion of something you WOULDN'T wear to the Prom?

KIERAN
Pineapple!

DANNY
Alright, I think heard "Chuck E. Cheese costume."

The performers start pantomiming an over-the-top improv scene. Lots of object work - it's a Chuck E. Cheese prom. This continues until the Ensemble bridge. Kieran moves from the audience to the side of the stage (stage right), and Mel moves to the other side (stage left). Kieran watches the show while turning to the real audience to deliver the lines.

!    KIERAN
~I'm a Level One improv student
~And I think this is really good

Mel steps forward in front of the stage (stage left) and delivers the lines to the audience.

!    MEL
~I'm their Level Three improv teacher
~And they aren't sweeping scenes as quickly as they should!

Casey, from stage right, walks across the front of the stage while singing. They plant for the majority of the line deliveries.

!    CASEY
~I've seen so many shows that I don't even know
~How to tell what's good anymore
~Standup, improv, and sketch, must be funny, I guess

Casey begins to head toward the lobby door, and actually leaves.

!    CASEY (CONT'D)
~If I hear them laughing through the door!

Casey slams the door in time with the song.

!    ENSEMBLE
~Our stakes are low
~Our crowds are small
~We do our best
~And laugh through it all

Vic and Shawn perform improv behind Danny while Danny delivers their lines.

!    DANNY
~Alt comedy theater
~In a mid-size rust belt city
~Everyone knows everyone
~Our community is itty bitty

Vic and Danny perform improv behind Shawn while Shawn delivers their lines.

!    SHAWN
~Alt comedy theater
~It's not the place you really wanna be
~If you long for something bigger
~If you're anything like me

Mel, Kieran, and Casey get on stage, and the whole group sings the final chorus.

!    ENSEMBLE
~Alt comedy theater
~All our best bits on display
~Here is where we live and we love, and we...

Each singer sustains the "away" until the end, and then they all shout "BLACKOUT!" in time with the conclusion of the song.

!    SHAWN
~Laugh our lives away!

!    MEL
~Away!


!    DANNY
~Away!


!    VIC
~Away!


!    CASEY & KIERAN
~Away!

*... 2, 3, 4-*


!    ENSEMBLE
~Blackout!

Lights black out in time with the music as the song ends. Mel comes back on stage and the lights come back.

MEL
And that's our show! Go to our website "altcomedy.biz" for information about all our upcoming shows and workshops. And please hang out and grab another drink. Have a good night!

Shawn and Danny are up on stage while the rest of the group sticks around on the sides. The lights change to indicate that the show has ended.

DANNY
Hey, great set.

SHAWN
Thanks, you too.

DANNY
Really solid object work. I mean I truly believed there was a trash can with a flip lid out there.

SHAWN
Yeah? I wasn't sure if anyone got that.

DANNY
Well it helped that you said it out loud. Though I don't think you're supposed to do that.

SHAWN
Hey, I know the rules, and therefore, I can break them. Besides, I know I'm better than you at least.

Shawn looks over at Mel and grabs their attention.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Right Mel?

MEL
What's that?

SHAWN
I'm better than Danny at improv, right?

MEL
Oh, come on, guys. It's not about better or worse. You're both great. I did have some notes though...

DANNY
Okay, let's hear them.

MEL
I just think you can do more to ground your characters. For example, the scene where...

Mel checks their notes.

MEL (CONT'D)
You were a capo in the clown mob?

DANNY
Right! With the silly string garrote.

Danny mimes choking someone with a silly string garrote.

MEL
Yeah. That was fun, but I wanted you to get to the emotional truth of the scene.

Danny does a Godfather face and gestures Italianly.

DANNY
I was a harlequin mobster! What more could I have said?

MEL
I would have liked to see a little more humanity.

DANNY
Alright, note taken. That's fair.

MEL
Now, Shawn...

SHAWN
What? I am always extremely human and emotional.

MEL
Um, right. Maybe sometimes... too much? Like the scene where...

Mel checks their notes again.

MEL (CONT'D)
You were an octopus at the tailor.

SHAWN
Right, mhm.

MEL
You didn't really mention being an octopus, or being at the tailor. You mostly talked about your fraught relationship with your mother.

SHAWN
Yeah I thought that was funny.

MEL
Right, but maybe you could have leaned into the comedy a bit more.

SHAWN
Okay I disagree but thank you.

Mel runs their hand through their hair frustratedly.

MEL
You people... 

Mel gets a far-off look in their eye.

MEL
Actually... show idea. American Idol but with improv, so I can judge you live on stage.

SHAWN
Yes! I could finally prove I'm your favorite!

DANNY
Careful there, Shawn. Your "Former Gifted Kid" syndrome is showing.

Vic struts past them.

DANNY (CONT'D)
And hey, speaking of former gifted kids. Great job tonight, Vic.

VIC
(snidely)
I do the best I can with what I'm given.

SHAWN
What's that supposed to mean?

VIC
Oh, nothing. We can talk about it later.

SHAWN
(to Mel)
Any notes for Vic?

MEL
Um... just a general note... really funny overall, but you could be a more supportive scene partner in some situations.

VIC
Well, maybe these two could support *me* a bit more.

MEL
Yes, more support is always good.

VIC
I gotta go.

Vic walks off-stage in a huff.

DANNY
I swear, that kid is the most serious comedian I have ever met.

MEL
Is that a bad thing?

DANNY
No. I don't know.

Kieran sheepishly approaches the stage.

KIERAN
Hi, I'm Kieran. I just wanted to say you are amazing, that was so funny.

DANNY
Why thank you! I don't think I've seen you around before, you taking a class or something?

KIERAN
Yep, just about to finish Level One. I started doing stand-up way back when (almost six months ago), but I LOVE improv.

SHAWN
Well you're in the right place. Everybody here does every type of comedy. Also everybody here is non-binary.

KIERAN
Oh yeah I was wondering why we all have gender-neutral names.

DANNY
Stick with improv though, it's the best. And hopefully we'll see you up here someday.

KIERAN
That would be an honor.

SHAWN
It's really not th--

Kieran interrupts Shawn, looking off into the distance dramatically.

KIERAN
To grace this stage... that would be a dream come true.

SHAWN
I feel like you should set your sights a little higher.

KIERAN
Oh, I don't know, I think this is great. You're all so wonderful.

SHAWN
I'm going to get another drink.

Casey peeks through the lobby door.

CASEY
Bar's closing!

DANNY
Aw, come on, Casey - one more?

CASEY
I am so tired. I have to go home.

SHAWN
I guess I'll be getting that drink somewhere else.

DANNY
Sixth City Backgammon?

SHAWN
Sure.

DANNY
(to Mel)
Sixth City Backgammon?
(to Kieran)
Sixth City Backgammon?

MEL
I've gotta get back to my dog.

KIERAN
Me too.

DANNY
Well, let's go, Shawn.

All exit.

int. sixth city backgammon - night #2#

Later that night. Shawn and Danny are sitting and playing backgammon at a table, empty glasses on either side. There's a "Sixth City Backgammon" sign.

SHAWN
Why is every bar in Cleveland like this now?

DANNY
I like it. Backgammon is fun.

SHAWN
I think it's time to go home.

DANNY
Booooo.

Shawn looks extremely sad.

DANNY (CONT'D)
Hey, you alright?

SHAWN
I'm fine.

DANNY
Then why do you look utterly devastated right now?

SHAWN
No, I'm good.

DANNY
You had a good show, you made fifteen whole dollars, and you beat me at backgammon like five times. It's been a fun night!

SHAWN
A good show. Not a great show.

DANNY
It was good! It was really good!

SHAWN
But it wasn't *great*. I could have been better.

DANNY
Why do you care so much about being "great"?

SHAWN
(hesitant)
I can't--

Danny comes over to Shawn's side of the table and kneels down next to them.

DANNY (CONT'D)
You gotta learn to love yourself more. If you could see yourself through my eyes--

SHAWN
I don't care. That's not going to make me any better at comedy.

DANNY
That's not the point! Don't you want to be happier?

SHAWN
I'd rather hate myself and be great than love myself and be mid.

Danny stands back up, exasperated.

DANNY
Oof, that is not healthy Shawn. Did you get that promo code for BetterHelp I sent you?

SHAWN
The one you got from the Slugslop Fatboys Podcast?

Danny shakes their head because it's irrelevant where they got the promo code.

DANNY
Did you use it?

SHAWN
Yeah, yeah. Apparently I'm supposed to have gratitude for my stupid wonderful intricate life.

DANNY
That sounds reasonable.

SHAWN
I have gratitude! I do! I just... I want more. I wanted tonight to be better.

Danny begins to pace around the stage while Shawn continues to sit there.

DANNY
What did you expect? That you'd have a performance so earth-shatteringly good that by the end, in hysterical fits of laughter, the entire audience would give you a ten minute standing ovation?

SHAWN
I mean...

DANNY
That they would tell all their friends, including everyone you went to high school with, that you are spectacular and fabulous and terrific beyond measure? And that you would then somehow gain five hundred thousand Instagram followers overnight?

SHAWN
That would be cool.

DANNY
And that that would, in turn, lead to a lifelong career in entertainment more successful than that of Taylor Swift and Beyoncé combined? Is that what you expected? Is it?!

SHAWN
I mean, kinda, yeah. Some little part of me always expects that.

DANNY
Exactly that, all that that I just said?

SHAWN
Something like that. Something unfathomably, impossibly good.

Shawn stands up.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
That's what I want.

DANNY
Oh, Shawn.

**[SONG 2: THE BEST OF ALL TIME]**

===

>_SONG 2: THE BEST OF ALL TIME_<

Shawn sings to Danny, but also to their imagined fans. Danny reacts skeptically to what Shawn is saying. Jesse, Phyllis, Everett and Tina are in the wings behind the curtains for this. Shawn addresses the audience, starry-eyed as they imagine this vast landscape of pure adoration.

!    SHAWN
~I require
~Universal acclaim
~Unbelievable fortune
~And indescribable fame

~Stadiums full of people
~Cheering and chanting my name
~All around the world
~I want to hear them all proclaim

Shawn pretends to be their fans, a different fan for each line.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

Shawn turns to Danny, pointing at them almost angrily.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~I don't want them to love me
~Unconditionally
~I want rigid conditions
~That I easily meet

Shawn turns to the audience and back to the fantasy.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~I want them to know me
~Complete and totally
~And seeing me entirely
~I want them to decree

~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

Shawn reveals a sadness for the first time.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~I know that I am not deserving of their love
~But I'm pining for it every day
~And even though I know I'll never be enough
~I still hope someday they will say...

Shawn quiets down a bit.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

Disembodied heads (Jesse, Everett, Phyllis, Tina) appear from behind the curtains in the wings, and sing along with Shawn. This builds in momentum.

!    ENSEMBLE
~Shawn, we adore you
~Shawn, we'd do anything for you
~Shawn, we would never ignore you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

The disembodied heads disappear.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Shawn, you're the best of all...

A moment of pause. Shawn weeps and chuckles, crumbling to the floor. Danny squats down and hugs them. Shawn rests their head on Danny's shoulder.

SHAWN
Crying in a backgammon bar. Not a good look, huh?

DANNY
Don't worry. I've cried in worse places.

Danny looks off into the distance. Fade out.

int. hollywood office - day #3#

There are palm trees through the window outside. The office is adorned with comedy show posters and plants. PHYLLIS (30s, businessy) is pacing around the room, talking on the phone. JESSE (20s, tik tok teen) sits at a desk and stays quiet.

PHYLLIS
(on phone)
Alright, but--
Yes, I know, and I will, I just--
You don't think we can find that here in L.A.?
(deep breath)
Okay. I understand.

Phyllis hangs up the phone.

JESSE
Bad news?

Phyllis nods.

PHYLLIS
You know how we have quarterly viewership targets?

JESSE
And how we always fall short of them by a large margin?

PHYLLIS
Right. Well, last quarter... let's just say it's worse than usual. We might not make it to Q4.

JESSE
No! A streaming service exclusively for comedy nerds is an evergreen business model! Chuckle Plus can never die.

PHYLLIS
I'm afraid it might. Our show where dogs re-enact current events has *not* been well received.

JESSE
The Puppy Post?? But I love that show! HotMilkGirlie394 even reposted a clip of it on TikTok!

PHYLLIS
Even HotMilkGirlie394's millions of followers aren't enough to save us this time.

JESSE
What about our legacy shows?

PHYLLIS
Improvised City Council is steady, but... Naked Millionaire Island has been slipping.

JESSE
Oh no! Phyllis, that show was your baby.

PHYLLIS
I know, Jesse. And it was...
(wistful)
captivating, subversive, even beautiful when it started... but times have changed.

JESSE
It's true. My generation is completely times-have-changed pilled.

PHYLLIS
Whatever that means, Everett is desperate to tap into it. We need something new. They're sending the casting directors all over... Pittsburgh, Saint Louis, Quebec...

JESSE
And where are we going?

PHYLLIS
Well...
(deep sigh)
We're going to Cleveland.

JESSE
Cleveland, OHIO?

PHYLLIS
It's not my first choice, but... I believe in us. We were born to do this.

Jesse looks hesitant.

JESSE
I mean, I think I was born to make viral YouTube Shorts about the emergent psychology of earthworms, but...

PHYLLIS
But nothing! There's someone out there just waiting to be discovered. Someone who can save our whole business!

JESSE
And we're going to find that someone in Cleveland?

PHYLLIS
At least we're not going to Youngstown.

JESSE
Hey! My glue-addicted step-cousin is from Youngstown.

PHYLLIS
Yes, Jesse. Everyone has a glue-addicted step-cousin from Youngstown. Cleveland is different. Cleveland... rocks! Drew Carey!

JESSE
(nodding)
Drew Carey. I guess the Mistake on the Lake's not so bad.

PHYLLIS
It's our only hope. If we don't find someone there... that's it for us.

**[SONG 3: CLEVELAND]**

===

>_SONG 3: CLEVELAND_<

Phyllis starts singing to Cleveland (looking off yonder). Phyllis is also presenting a PowerPoint - holding a clicker and flipping through slides.

!    PHYLLIS
~Cleveland
~Give me something to believe in
~Something in which to believe
~Something hiding up your sleeve
~Save us from fiscal devastation

~Cleveland
~I need a superstar next season
~You can give me what I need
~I want so badly to succeed
~And Cleveland, you can be the reason

Phyllis turns to Jesse, with severe determination.

!    PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~I've gotta find
~A diamond in the rough
~Any neighborhood will do
~West Park, Tremont, or Hough

~They tell me that in Cleveland you
~Have got to be tough
~So I know there must be someone there
~Who's got the right stuff

Jesse starts singing with Phyllis.

!    PHYLLIS & JESSE
~In Cleveland
~Protect our service from deletion
~Quibi got it pretty quick
~And we know Seeso couldn't stick
~But maybe we can keep on streamin'

~If we go to Cleveland
~Even though we might be freezin'
~Amidst the potholes and the ice
~We'll find a Great Lakes paradise
~From which we'll pull our next sensation

Jesse and Phyllis sing to each other.

!    JESSE
~We'll find someone hot
~Like a river on fire

!    PHYLLIS
~Someone to make the ladies laugh
~And all the boys perspire

!    JESSE
~Someone with pure midwestern charm

!    PHYLLIS
~And also cutting satire

!    JESSE
~Someone to take our lowly ratings
~And make them higher

!    PHYLLIS
~Not sure if I know
~Exactly why-oh
~But I know I-oh
~I just have to fly-oh
~Straight to Ohio
~And more specifically...

Phyllis steps forward and gets on their knees - a clear show of desperation.

!    PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~Cleveland
~Give me someone to believe in
~Someone in whom to believe
~Someone hiding up your sleeve
~Save us from fiscal devastation

Phyllis stands back up, and Jesse joins in the song.

!    PHYLLIS & JESSE
~Oh, Cleveland
~We need a superstar next season
~You can give us what we need
~We want so badly to succeed
~And Cleveland, you can be the reason

Key change.

!    PHYLLIS & JESSE (CONT'D)
~It's Cleveland
~And the Greater Cleveland region
~Gave us Big Chuck and Lil' John
~Travis Kelce and LeBron
~I just need one more great comedian
~I'm begging you

~Cleveland
~Best location in the nation

Jesse drops out.

!    PHYLLIS
~You're my last and only shot
~Please tell me that you've got
~Someone to lead us to salvation
~Someone from Cleveland

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Pack your bags, Jesse. The forest city awaits.

int. comedy theater class space - day #4#

Back in Cleveland, this time in a rehearsal/class space. An improv class is taking place, led by Mel. Vic is present. There are notebooks and bags on the floor. Danny and Shawn are acting out a scene in the stage area. Danny melodramatically crawls around on all fours.

DANNY
Four.

Danny does something really stupid, and starts to giggle.

SHAWN
(perplexed)
Five?

Danny tries (and fails) to stifle laughter.

DANNY
Seven!

Danny cannot hold in the laughter and fully breaks.

MEL
(exasperated)
Seriously, this is improv four. No breaking! And you didn't even say the right number! You're acting like level one up there. Danny, swap with Vic. Can I get a location?

DANNY
A drawing room.

MEL
Okay, a... "drawing" room.

Vic goes up and Danny sits down to watch. Shawn and Vic act out an intense, dark, quick scene using numbers in place of dialogue. It culminates with Vic stabbing Shawn in the back.

VIC
One.

SHAWN
Two.

VIC
Three.

SHAWN
Four.

VIC
Five!

SHAWN
Six!

Vic faces Shawn with their back to the audience.

VIC
Seven!

MEL
Remember to cheat out.

Vic adjusts to face the audience, while still looking at Shawn.

SHAWN
Eight!

VIC
Nine.

Vic stabs Shawn in the back.

SHAWN
(through tears)
Ten.

Shawn falls over fake dead, and Vic sits there still. After a second, Mel starts clapping weakly, and Danny sort of does too.

MEL
Thank you, thank you.

Mel checks their watch.

MEL
On that note, class is over! The next class will be here any minute so we gotta get outta here. See you all next week, great job today everyone.

The improv students start to pack up their belongings and start to chatter.

DANNY
Why does Vic end up killing you in like every scene you guys do?

SHAWN
Hmm. I don't know!

Danny, Shawn, and Vic head for the door. Kieran enters, wearing a backpack, ready for class.

MEL
One last thing: someone from Chuckle Plus is going to be here this weekend holding auditions for a new show.

KIERAN
Oh my God.

VIC
*THE* Chuckle Plus?

MEL
The one and only Chuckle Plus. They must've heard we've got talent here in Cleveland.

SHAWN
(dreamily)
Yeah. Yeah...

MEL
I don't really *get* all of their shows, but...

DANNY
Chuckle Plus is great! They have a show where they give someone a makeover and then make them freestyle rap.

MEL
People do seem to like them.

KIERAN
More like *love* them.

MEL
I guess we could start doing some shows like that. What about... improvised... slam poetry... cosplay? ...

DANNY
We should probably leave that sort of thing to Chuckle Plus. They do it up well over there.

SHAWN
Danny's right, Chuckle Plus is great.

VIC
I love Chuckle Plus.

KIERAN
I have a parasocial relationship with *every* cast member.

DANNY
Well hey, maybe you'll get to have a regular-social relationship with them now!

SHAWN
What are they looking for?

MEL
It's sounds like they'll take anything even remotely adjacent to comedy. Characters, impressions, performance art, mime stuff... they seem pretty desperate.

Mel starts putting up a sign on the class bulletin board.

SHAWN
Oh wow.

DANNY
Wow.

KIERAN
Wow.

VIC
Wow.

SHAWN
This... this is a sign.

DANNY
You mean the sign Mel's put up that says "AUDITIONS THIS WEEKEND"?

SHAWN
Yes. I've gotta get ready. This could be my destiny.

VIC
This could be *my* destiny.

DANNY
Heck, I'll throw my hat in the ring.

KIERAN
This... this could be it.

**[SONG 4: THIS COULD BE IT]**

===

>_SONG 4: THIS COULD BE IT_<

This is a montage song with a lot of action. Shawn, Vic, Danny, and Kieran are all on stage the whole time, doing various things. It starts with each character pacing and thinking, quietly but frenetically.

!    SHAWN (whispered)
~This could be it

!    KIERAN (whispered)
~This could be it

!    VIC (whispered)
~This could be it

!    DANNY (whispered)
~This could be it

!    SHAWN (whispered)
~This could be it

Shawn steps forward as the rest of the characters drift into the background. Kieran, Vic, and Danny start preparing for the audition.

!    KIERAN (whispered)
~This could be it

!    VIC (whispered)
~This could be it

!    DANNY (whispered)
~This could be it

Shawn starts singing with confidence and determination.

!    SHAWN
~I've gotta show them what I've got
~I'm gonna write a brand new sketch
~And when they witness what I've wrought

Shawn sings the last line nervously.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~I hope they'll think that I'm the best

Vic steps forward, and Shawn steps back, pulling out a notebook and starting to write.

!    DANNY & KIERAN
~This could be it

!    VIC
~I've got a character up here

Vic points at their head.

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~That's sure to sweep them off their feet
~I'm gonna have my dream career
~I don't care who I have to beat

Everyone faces the audience and sings.

!    DANNY & KIERAN
~This could be it

!    VIC
~Been waiting my whole life for something like this

!    SHAWN
~Somebody to tell me this is why you exist

!    VIC
~This is my shot, and I know I can't miss

!    DANNY & KIERAN
~This could be it

!    SHAWN
~This could finally open the door

!    VIC
~To my big break and to so much more

!    KIERAN
~I'm gonna leave it all on the floor

!    SHAWN & VIC
~This could be it

Shawn, Vic, and Kieran go back to preparing - acting things out, practicing character bits, etc.

!    DANNY
~I've got some accents sure to please
~Oui mon fran-sez, eel-ay tray bien!
~I say ze french, zey smell like cheese
~But it's cool 'cause I'm a quarter french

!    SHAWN & VIC
~This could be it

Shawn, Vic, and Danny are continuing to prepare - but turn to face the audience whenever they whisper their ensemble lines.

!    KIERAN
~I've got a notebook full of bits

Kieran pulls out a little notebook.

===

!    ENSEMBLE (whispered)
~This could be it
~This could be it

!    KIERAN
~One joke I'm really psyched about

!    ENSEMBLE (whispered)
~This could be it
~This could be it

!    KIERAN
~I'm hoping when the punchline hits

Kieran punches the air in front of them.

!    ENSEMBLE (whispered)
~This could be it
~This could be it

!    KIERAN
~It's strong enough to knock 'em out

!    ENSEMBLE
~This could be it
~Been waiting my whole life for something like this
~Somebody to tell me this is why you exist
~This is my shot and I know I can't miss
~This could be it

!    SHAWN
~They said I was gifted when I was a kid
~Then after fourteen, I don't know what I did
~I wanna be great, I don't wanna be mid
~This could be it

Vic, Kieran, and Danny fade into the background. Shawn steps forward. A spotlight shines on Shawn (first spotlight of the show!)

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~And what if this is it?
~What if this is all there is?
~I think this might be it

Shawn steps back, everyone else steps forward.

!    ENSEMBLE
~This could be it
~Been waiting my whole life for something like this
~Somebody to tell me this is why you exist
~This is my shot and I know I can't miss
~This could be it

Ensemble repeats the chorus while Shawn and Vic sing their previous choruses.

SHAWN
~They said I was gifted when I was a kid / then after 14 I don't know what I did / I wanna be great, I don't wanna be mid

VIC^
~This could finally open the door / to my big break and to so much more / I'm gonna leave it all on the floor

DANNY & KIERAN^
~Been waiting my whole life for something like this / somebody to tell me this is why I exist / this is my shot and I know I can't miss

!    ENSEMBLE
~This could be it!

After the song, everybody scatters with gusto - ready to go home and continue their preparations.

int. comedy theater stage - day #5#

It's the big audition day. Mel enters, leading Phyllis and Jesse behind.

MEL
(overly chipper)
You get in okay? How was the flight?

PHYLLIS
(flat, down-to-business)
It was fine.

They approach the stage and Mel gestures grandly.

MEL
And here's the stage. Anything I can do to help? Anything you need?

PHYLLIS
We've got it from here.

MEL
You sure? Coffee, Kirkland-brand sparkling water, anything? Anyone have any dietary restrictions?

JESSE
Oh, actually I *am* doing the 15 Musketeers diet.

MEL
Ooh, sounds fancy! Is that an L.A. thing?

PHYLLIS
It's not fancy. It just means they eat nothing but 3 Musketeers bars.

JESSE
I have to eat exactly five per day.

MEL
Well, we don't have 3 Musketeers, but we do have Milky Way bars if that works!

JESSE
No, not at all. It's fine, I have my own supply.

Jesse pulls out a bag with like twenty 3 Musketeers bars in it.

MEL
Well I'm happy to run out and grab more! Or pick up something else for lunch, or do your laundry, or help you with your taxes...

PHYLLIS
We're good, thank you.

MEL
Great! I'll be right over here if you need anything.

Mel hops to the side of the stage and starts fiddling with a laptop.

PHYLLIS
(quietly to Jesse)
Is everyone in the midwest this over-the-top nice?

Phyllis and Jesse begin to setup their table and camera.

JESSE
All I know is, Uber is *very* cheap here.

PHYLLIS
Must be because there's nothing going on.

Mel turns to look at them on the stage.

MEL
Actually, there's a ton of stuff to do here! In Cleveland, we've got world-class experiences without the world-class ego.

PHYLLIS
What's that?

MEL
With three major sports teams, the second-largest theater district in the country, and a FREE top-of-the-line art museum, it's harder to find things *not* to do!

PHYLLIS
Are you just reciting copy from the Cleveland tourism website?

MEL
Not at all! This is all from the heart. If there's one thing to love about Cleveland, it's...
(tearing up)
the authenticity of our people. You know, Lake Erie might be a freshwater lake, but the people of Cleveland...
(back to chipper)
They're salt of the earth. This is THE LAND!

JESSE
People from Cleveland really have a lot to say about Cleveland, don't they?

MEL
Just speaking my truth. Okay, I'll let you get back to setting up. I'll just... wait in the lobby.

Mel leaves.

JESSE
Okay I don't know what all that was about, but I do know you shouldn't give up on Cleveland yet.

PHYLLIS
It's hard to keep my expectations high.

Phyllis rubs their forehead to show that they are tired. They finish setting up.

JESSE
Well, that's the key to happiness, right?

PHYLLIS
Huh?

JESSE
Low expectations, the--

PHYLLIS
(shouting)
Alright, bring 'em in!

Kieran, Vic, Shawn and Danny enter and stand off to the side of the stage.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Let's get through this as quickly as possible. You each have five minutes. Up first is...

Phyllis looks at their notebook.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Kieran Allen-Johnson.

KIERAN
Wish me luck, guys!

Danny gives Kieran a big thumbs up as they step on stage.

PHYLLIS
Let's see it.

KIERAN
These are some jokes I wrote.

They pull out their little notebook and read from it directly.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
What was the cat doing in the bag in the first place?

No reaction.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
If you add insult to injury you get insz-jullt-tree!

No reaction, but Kieran continues unfazed. 

KIERAN (CONT'D)
If you had a bookstore that was also a farm for exclusively female cattle, it would be called Barns and No Bull.

Again, no reaction. Vic and Shawn converse with each other by the wings. Kieran continues to tell jokes, without actually speaking. They also start putting on a pair of sunglasses and take out a mobility cane.

VIC
How much more of this do we have to take?

SHAWN
I don't know, I think these are kind of funny.

KIERAN
I'm a duck hunter. Whenever I go hunting, everybody has to duck!

Phyllis and Jesse cringe.

SHAWN
Okay, that one was bad.

Kieran just stands there for a moment.

VIC
What are they doing now? Why are they just standing there?

PHYLLIS
Is... that all?

KIERAN
Oh, yes, sorry!

Kieran runs off-stage. Phyllis starts writing down some notes.

VIC
Well, the good news is I'll have no problem beating that sorry excuse for a comic.

DANNY
Oh come on. They were trying their best.

VIC
Their best is awful. I am so much better.

SHAWN
Why not just be the best YOU can be?

DANNY
Yeah, like the US Army.

Danny does a salute. Shawn ignores Danny and continues talking to Vic.

SHAWN
Why do you have to belittle others?

VIC
Comedy's a competition, Shawn.

Phyllis has finished taking notes.

PHYLLIS
Next up, we have... Vic Nixon.

Vic steps up to the stage.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
What have you got for us, Vic?

VIC
This is a character called Canadian Gangster.

Vic steps into character, and grabs the mic.

VIC (CONT'D)
(Canadianly)
Hey there, hoser. I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse, eh? No worries if you want to refuse it though.

The backing track starts playing. Phyllis and Jesse smile. Vic continues to perform the "Canadian Gangster" character but without sound while the ensemble repeats the "comedy's a competition" line for the first four times. Vic breaks out of the character to start rapping. The lighting changes as well to indicate that this is not literally what Vic is saying.

**[SONG 5: COMEDY'S A COMPETITION]**

===

>_SONG 5: COMEDY'S A COMPETITION_<

Vic has the mic for this, which is necessary because part of the song has **autotune**. Phyllis and Jesse are behind a table on the side of the stage, watching Vic perform the whole time. Vic cheats out and performs for the audience. Phyllis, Jesse, and other characters in the wings say the Ensemble parts - just the "Comedy's a competition" line.

!    ENSEMBLE
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition

!    VIC
~I was raised in this, watchin' Whose Line from birth
~You could search every corner of the earth

~You won't find anybody who's as funny as me
~Not in L.A., not in Chicago, not in N.Y.C.

~I'm puttin' C.L.E. on the M.A.P.
~All around the globe, three hundred sixty degrees

~Fahrenheit, I could scorch y'all with all this heat
~This is the roast of everybody and I'm the emcee

!    VIC & ENSEMBLE
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition
~Comedy's a competition

Ensemble continues saying "Comedy's a competition."

!    VIC
~Comedy's a competition (and I'm winnin')
~Comedy's a competition (and I'm winnin')
~Comedy's a competition (and I'm winnin')
~Comedy's a competition (and I'm winnin')

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~I can make you laugh even if you're anhedonic
~Just me on the mic, but I still sound symphonic

~Orchestrating punchlines like a joke philharmonic
~Words from every angle like it's stereophonic

~When I say I'm laconic you know I'm being ironic
~I'm verbose and sardonic; make Einstein look moronic

~I am chronically iconic and quicker than supersonic
~Need a tonic, 'cause I'm an iller killer than the bubonic

~Plague

Vic pauses, seemingly rethinking. The **autotune** turns on. Vic sings oohs and ahhs into the microphone.

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~Maybe all of this is just a defense mechanism
~Maybe deep down inside I yearn for recognition
~Because my dad never loved me without condition
~Maybe that's the source of all of my ambition

~And maybe comedy could be more to me
~Like community instead of rivalry
~Maybe I should change my position

Vic's demeanor changes back to how it was before. The **autotune** turns off.

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~Just kiddin'

Ensemble continues saying the "Comedy's a competition" line.

!    VIC
~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~Comedy's a competition
~Since the beginnin'

~Comedy's a competition
~I keep 'em grinnin'
~Comedy's a competition
~Never lost, I'm always winnin

~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'

~Comedy's a competition
~And I'm winnin'
~Comedy's a competition

The ensemble cuts out for the last line.

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~And I'm winnin'

Vic bows. Phyllis applauds enthusiastically.

PHYLLIS
Wonderful! I *loved* the bit about the crooked mounties. Thank you.

JESSE
Not too bad, huh?

PHYLLIS
Not too bad.

Phyllis takes some quick notes.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Next is... Shawn Carpenter.

Vic steps off stage as Shawn steps up.

VIC
See if you can top that.

Shawn looks distressed. They nervously turn to face Phyllis and Jesse.

SHAWN
(Italianly)
Oh, mamma mia, the meat-a-ball! I--

Shawn cuts off.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
(normal)
I-- okay, I can't do this. New plan. I'm going to improvise something based on Vic's audition.

Phyllis looks exhausted.

PHYLLIS
Wonderful. Improv is always good. Let's hear it.

Shawn mimes moose antlers and, in a very serious and unsilly manner, becomes the character of a Mafia Moose. Phyllis and Jesse start to laugh. The music begins, and Shawn breaks out of the Mafia Moose character to start singing. The lighting changes as well to indicate that this is not literally what Shawn is saying.

**[SONG 6: COMEDY'S A COMPETITION (REPRISE)]**

===

>_SONG 6: COMEDY'S A COMPETITION (REPRISE)_<

Shawn has the mic - necessary because it's **autotuned**.  Phyllis and Jesse are still behind the table. There are notebooks on the table. Shawn cheats out to perform for the audience. The ensemble is again Phyllis and Jesse and anyone from the wings, mostly just saying the word "Comedy" this time.

!   SHAWN
~Comedy's a competition
~I guess I compete against myself
~But now I'm here at this audition
~Wishin' I could be somebody else

~I'm just trying to be
~A better version of me
~I have low self-esteem
~But I'm in therapy

Ensemble says "comedy" along with Shawn.

!   SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Oh, it's comedy
~Self-deprecating comedy
~Self-doubtulating comedy
~This is humiliating comedy

~I'm not conventionally funny
~That's what they tell me all the time
~They also say I'm not conventionally attractive
~Which seems irrelevant but I guess it's fine

~I don't want to be conventional
~I want to be multi-dimensional
~I wanna get weirdly emotional
~And maybe start to cry

Ensemble once again says "comedy" with Shawn.

!   SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Is this still comedy?
~Yeah, it's just reprehensible comedy
~It's just inaccessible comedy
~Deeply personal comedy
~You see

~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   ENSEMBLE
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   SHAWN
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   ENSEMBLE
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   SHAWN
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   ENSEMBLE
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   SHAWN
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   ENSEMBLE
~I don't wanna compete, I just wanna connect

!   PHYLLIS
~I just wanna connect

Phyllis stands up, moved by the performance. Shawn starts to go sing again, but realizes Phyllis is singing and stops.

!   PHYLLIS
~Comedy's a competition

Shawn hands the mic to Phyllis.

!    PHLLIS (CONT'D)
~For me, it's been reduced to nothing more
~I used to laugh with reckless abandon
~Now I'm taking notes and keeping score

Phyllis throws the notebooks to the floor, and steps out from behind the table to sing to the audience.

!   PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~How I yearn to return
~To the way I was before
~When I'd L.O.L. and R.O.T.F.L.
~That stands for rolling on the floor
~Laughing at...

The ensemble (Shawn, Jesse, and people in the wings) sing "comedy" in the background.

!   PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~Comedy
~Oh, any sort of comedy
~I was in love with comedy
~Bring me back to comedy

As Shawn sings again, Phyllis repeats the previous lines and the rest of the ensemble sings "comedy."

!   SHAWN
~Oh it's comedy
~I wanna touch the deeply absurd
>(MORE)<
===

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Doing comedy
~Like no one's ever heard

~Oh it's comedy
~To be alive with love and mirth
~I need comedy
~Your laughter's my self-worth

Just Shawn for the last line.

!   SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Oh, comedy

Shawn bows. Phyllis is back in their seat and applauds.

JESSE
Wow. I have never seen Phyllis react like that to a performance.

VIC
(through grit teeth)
Good job.

PHYLLIS
Bravo, bravo, bravo. Wow. I truly cannot believe I was so emotionally moved by a scene with a moose in the mafia. Okay, next... Danny Bernadakis.

Danny steps up to the stage.

DANNY
This is a character called Boston Mark.

DANNY (CONT'D)
(Bostonly)
Hey, kid! How's your mum? You got your Dunkies? How about them Sox? Tom Brady. Tom Brady. Tom. Brady.

Phyllis is laughing heartily, their heart opened by Shawn's performance. Danny's audition continues and fades out.

int. comedy theater lobby - day #6#

Casey, Mel, and Kieran are hanging out in the lobby.

MEL
So you literally just google the word "news" to get your news?

CASEY
I cannot think of a better way.

KIERAN
There are *only* better ways. You know Google has a news tab, right?

CASEY
I don't know, that doesn't feel right.

MEL
Just download any app.

CASEY
Eh. I don't care enough about the news.

KIERAN
Wait, let me see that.

Kieran grabs Casey's phone.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
You just google the word "weather" to get your weather?

Casey grabs their phone back.

CASEY
It works for me!

KIERAN
No wonder you never know what's going on.

MEL
That gives me an idea for a show... Improv based on people's search history.

KIERAN
Oh, that's good. I would see that for sure.

Kieran pulls out their phone and begins to check it.

CASEY
As long as you don't use mine.

Kieran's eyes widen.

KIERAN
Hold on. Guys. Guys. I just got an email from Chuckle Plus.

MEL
And?

KIERAN
I... didn't get it.

CASEY
Tough luck, kid. You're young though, you'll have plenty more chances.

KIERAN
Sure, I... I gotta go.

They hold back tears as they exit.

CASEY
Oof. I remember when I used to feel things.

MEL
(pensive)
Yeah.
(over it)
Anyway, another show pitch - drunk improv. What do you--

Danny and Shawn enter, continuing a conversation.

SHAWN
No way. 150 gallons of breastmilk?

DANNY
I'm telling you. At *least* 150 gallons. Every day. And it's like toothpaste. Hey Casey. Hey Mel.

Everybody greets each other.

CASEY
You guys check your emails? Kieran just got one from Chuckle Plus.

Shawn's face is flush with excitement and nervousness. They shakily pull out their phone.

SHAWN
Oh my God.

DANNY
What is it?

SHAWN
I got a callback.

DANNY
That's great!

CASEY
We should celebrate! I'll google "pizza."

SHAWN
Yeah, I... I can't do it.

Danny checks their phone as well, and sees that they also got a callback.

DANNY
Why not? I'll be there. Look, I got one too!

Danny shows Shawn their phone.

SHAWN
Yay! But, it's, uh... I can't miss my cousin's briss.

DANNY
Isn't your whole family Catholic?

SHAWN
Yeah... it's a Catholic briss...

DANNY
I know your family. None of your cousins are younger than 15.

SHAWN
Yeah he's actually... just getting it touched up...

DANNY
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn. Stop making excuses. What happened to "I want to be the very best like no one ever was?"

SHAWN
But what if...
(sigh)
what if I can never be the best? What if it all goes wrong?

CASEY
Okay, worst case, yes. It goes terribly, terribly wrong.

DANNY
Sure.

CASEY
Like, really horrendously, tragically wrong.

DANNY
Okay, that's enough. Even if it does go terribly, terribly wrong. You owe it to yourself to try.

Shawn thinks for a moment.

SHAWN
You're right. I'm gonna do it.

DANNY
Yeah!

Shawn and Danny high five.

ext. street outside the theater - day #7#

Vic is alone, pacing back and forth outside the theater, refreshing their phone.

VIC
Come on, come on... I'm outside, I should have service!

They refresh their phone again, and see a new email appear. They quickly scan it.

VIC (CONT'D)
Yes! I knew it. Yes, yes, yes!

They continue pacing, now more excited.

VIC (CONT'D)
Okay. I got this. Smooth sailing from here. As long as... well, there's really only one person who could beat me. If they don't make it, I'll be good. If they do... I'll figure it out. I just really hope they didn't give a callback to...

Shawn comes out onto the street. Vic's demeanor changes to an overly-exuberant facade of friendliness.

VIC (CONT'D)
Shawn! Hey buddy.

SHAWN
Hey Vic. What are you doing out here? We're all hanging out inside.

VIC
Oh, you know me. Just uh... here early for my show. Punctuality! My only vice.

SHAWN
Oh yeah. Mine's ice cream.

VIC
Hahaha, you're so funny.

SHAWN
Thanks. Hey, speaking of that... did you hear from Chuckle Plus?

VIC
Oh, uh, yeah! I did get one. And, you...?

SHAWN
Yep, somehow I did.

Vic's facade of joy breaks a little bit.

VIC
And you're planning to go?

SHAWN
Danny convinced me.

VIC
Oh, wonderful! Hey, I've got an idea. Let me book our flight. I'm a rewards member for every airline, I can get us a great deal.

SHAWN
Yeah, I guess that could--

VIC
We can sit together! It will be so fun!

SHAWN
Alright, sure.

VIC
Great. I'll do it right now. You can pay me back whenever.

SHAWN
Okay, I guess that's...

Vic pulls out their phone again and quickly taps away at a flight booking website.

VIC
Done! I just forwarded you the confirmation email.

Shawn pulls out their phone to check.

SHAWN
That was really fast.

VIC
That's my other vice.

SHAWN
Ha, yeah. Well, thanks. What a whirlwind. How much was--

VIC
Oh, don't worry about it. We'll sort all that out later. You just get ready for the big audition.

SHAWN
Yeah, you too!

VIC
May the best comedian win.

SHAWN
Right.

Shawn departs, leaving Vic alone again. Vic sneers menacingly, and begins to laugh. They put their fingers together like Mr. Burns.

VIC
Yes, yes. The "best" comedian. Ha ha ha. I'll make sure there's only one "best" comedian. Ha ha ha.

**[SONG 7: BAD BAD BADDIE]**

===

>_SONG 7: BAD BAD BADDIE_<

Vic is alone on stage for this. There are some tempo changes. Also, Vic should be snapping during the verses - the ensemble can join that as well.

!    VIC
~Comedy's a competition... and I'm a villain
~I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stay winnin'

~I might do something nice, but it's all just an act
~When you turn around, you'll get stabbed in the back

~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad, who's your daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie

~I'm a cartoon villain; Cruella De Vil
~Make a coat out of you on stage when I kill

~I'm so Divine, I inspired a sea witch
~I'm Ursula, baby, and I'm leavin' you speechless

~Call me a Captain, 'cause you're gonna get hooked
~Maleficently you're about to get cooked

~Need a round of applause, make way for Jafar
~You're gonna get the claws if you're messin' with Scar

~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad dad daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie

Start speeding up.

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~I'm gonna be on top - get out of my way
~No one's gonna stop me from having my day

~I'll get what I want, no matter the cost
~If you're up against me, you've already lost

~I'll dupe and I'll con, I'll trick and I'll cheat
~I'm not above treachery, fraud or deceit

~I'll beat anybody - do what I've gotta do
~Even if I have to sabotage you

~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad, who's your daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie

===

This part is the same tempo but the singing is slower, less frantic, more deliberate. Snapping is on the downbeat for this part, but switches back to the syncopated snaps for the final chorus.

!    VIC (CONT'D)
~I refuse to lose
~Under any circumstance
~I'll eliminate each threat
~No one else will stand a chance

Switch back to the syncopated snaps.

~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~Who's your dad dad dad, who's your daddy?
~I'm a bad bad bad bad baddie
~Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha

Vic takes out their phone, dials it, and puts it to their ear.

VIC (CONT'D)
(spoken)
Hi, I recently booked two tickets for a flight, and I'd like to cancel one of them. Ha ha ha. No sorry I'm just laughing maniacally. Ha ha ha ha-- yes I'll hold. Ha ha ha ha ha!
(singing)
~I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad baddie! Ha ha ha ha ha!

>_**ACT TWO**_<

int. airport - day #8#

It's early in the morning at the airport. TINA (older, severe) sits at a boarding pass booth while Shawn waits in line.

TINA
Next. I.D. and boarding pass.

SHAWN
Sure thing!

Shawn takes out their I.D. and their phone with the boarding pass. Tina scans it.

TINA
It's not going through.

SHAWN
What's that? Oh, let me turn my brightness up...

TINA
It's not your brightness. Your ticket was cancelled.

SHAWN
It was--

TINA
I'm sorry. Next!

SHAWN
Wait, can I -- get another ticket?

TINA
You can try customer service. But good luck finding another flight to L.A.X. this weekend.

SHAWN
Okay, can you--

TINA
Next!

SHAWN
No, no, this cannot be happening. I HAVE to be there today, I--

TINA
That is not my problem. This line's gotta keep moving. Next!

Shawn's frustration bubbles over. Midwest emo music begins part way through their rant. Tina just looks at Shawn uncaringly the whole time.

SHAWN
Please just have one tiny modicum of empathy for me here!

TINA
Excuse me?

SHAWN
I'm sorry, I know, I'm sure your job is a lot and I don't mean to take my frustration out on you but can you just feel something, can you try to understand! This is the most pivotal moment of my life and I'm just so-- every time I get my hopes up, and think I am worthy of anything good in my life, there's always something reminding me that I don't deserve anything good-- and you are so mad at me just for existing, and again, I know, this does not look like a fun job and I'm sure emotional labor is draining but do you see that I'm another person here? I have been trying so hard, and I just--

Shawn begins to sing, and Tina looks even more exhausted.

**[SONG 8: I'M SO TIRED]**

===

>_SONG 8: I'M SO TIRED_<

Shawn sings to Tina, and also to the universe.

!    SHAWN
~I don't think I can do this
~I can't do this anymore
~All the times I've been through this
~What am I doing it for?

~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired

~Existing is so exhausting
~Why do I have to be me?
~I don't know why I keep trying
~I'll never be who I want to be

!    TINA
~I understand what you're saying
~I'm tired all of the time
~But you're not really helping
~When you hold up my line

!    SHAWN & TINA
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired
~I'm so tired

!    SHAWN
~I just want to be free from all identity

By the end of the song, Tina has been moved (ever so slightly).

TINA
I'm sorry, honey. Next!

int. hollywood office - day #9#

Vic is on the makeshift stage, just finishing up an audition in front of EVERETT (40s, powerful but childish), Phyllis, and Jesse.

VIC
~This is my destiny
~They'll be obsessed with me
~If you're in the same room as me
~You're blessed to be
~No one can jest like me
~There's no one left to see
~You can forget about the rest
~Because the best is me
~I'm the best

Vic bows. Everett applauds enthusiastically.

EVERETT
Splendid. Really, really good.
(to Phyllis)
See? Cleveland has talent.

PHYLLIS
You were right, Everett. Just wait. You can go now, Vic.

EVERETT
We'll be in touch.

VIC
Thank you so much, it was a privilege.

Vic slowly starts to walk away, but lingers in the room.

PHYLLIS
Okay, our next performer... ah yes. Shawn.

Phyllis smiles widely.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
(to Jesse)
Can you--

JESSE
Yes, well - apparently Shawn isn't here yet.

Vic sneers.

VIC
Oh, yes, unfortunate. I think there might have been some sort of mix-up with the airline.

PHYLLIS
Oh, no. I really think... well... shoot.

EVERETT
We're on a schedule here. If Shawn couldn't be here on time, that's it.

PHYLLIS
Well, maybe...

EVERETT
No second chances. Besides, we have an... *excellent* pool of candidates already.

Everett winks at Vic.

PHYLLIS
Of course.

Vic is still standing there, kind of awkwardly smiling and trying to not seem evil.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Okay, seriously Vic, you can go now.

Vic departs. Phyllis is still a little distraught.

EVERETT
Just send in the next one.

Jesse walks over to stage right, and calls through the door.

JESSE
Alright, next up! Blake, from Saint Louis.

EVERETT
Just "Blake"?

JESSE
All it says is "Blake".

BLAKE (early 20s, extremely handsome) enters on all fours, wearing dog ears.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Okay, just slate your...

BLAKE
Woof! Woof!

Blake dances around as a dog a little bit, then gets up on two legs - becoming the character of dog owner. They wag their finger sternly at the dog character. They then get back down on all fours and do the dog thing again.

EVERETT
Alright, I think we've seen enough.

JESSE
You can go now.

Blake wimpers sadly, then crawls off the stage (still in dog character).

EVERETT
Oof. That one was rough.

PHYLLIS
I don't know, I think they had a unique perspective, and they--

EVERETT
Of course you liked it. But it wasn't marketable.

Phyllis complete's Everett's sentence.

PHYLLIS
Marketable, I know. I know.

EVERETT
We need people who are TikTokable. Right, Jesse?

JESSE
Yes. Our performers have to have the precisely perfect amount of brainrot. The dog person either didn't have enough or they had way too much.

PHYLLIS
They were up there doing their best. How can we reduce a human being to criteria like that?

EVERETT
That's like our whole thing. You've been doing it for years!

PHYLLIS
I know, but...

EVERETT
That's showbiz, baby.

PHYLLIS
That's showbiz.

**[SONG 9: THAT'S SHOWBIZ]**

===

>_SONG 9: THAT'S SHOWBIZ_<

Phyllis begins to sing to the audience. Theoretically, this is most "show-y" number of the show.

!    PHYLLIS
~We toil at the mercy of this merciless machine
~The almighty dollar, the all-holy green
~Creating "content" for a four point five inch screen
~With an aspect ratio of nine by sixteen

~All these poor saps come to L.A. to chase their dreams
~They pour their hearts out on the stage just to be seen
~But if the market finds no value in them to redeem

The lights go out when the music goes out. Phyllis changes into a glamourous costume with a sparkly top hat or something.

!    PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~We crush their aspirations into smithereens
~That's showbiz

When the bass drops, the lights go crazy. Phyllis does jazz hands and other dramatic showy gestures. There are sequins perhaps.

!    PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
~That's showbiz
~All I know is
~That's showbiz

Back to a sort of normal stage.

!    JESSE
~I moved here thinking I would find my perfect niche
~This job's alright, but it doesn't scratch that itch
~I'm not fulfilled, but I guess that I'm content
~It's not my calling, but I've gotta pay the rent

!    PHYLLIS
~That's showbiz

!    EVERETT
~Some say I only care about the bottom line
~But I'm just trying to keep this company alive
~If we wanna keep making shows our business has to thrive
~If we don't make money, we won't survive

The strobe is back.

!    ENSEMBLE
~That's showbiz
~That's showbiz
~All I know is
~That's showbiz

Additional lights flash on the stage.

!    ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
~That's showbiz

!    PHYLLIS
~They turned comedy
~Into a commodity

!    ENSEMBLE
~That's showbiz

!    PHYLLIS
~I don't think it oughta be
~But it isn't up to me

!    ENSEMBLE
~All I know is

!    PHYLLIS
~Art is more than just a byproduct of business

!    ENSEMBLE
~That's showbiz

!    PHYLLIS
~Somebody save me from this industry!

Everyone harmonizes on the last note to form a triad chord.

!    ENSEMBLE
~That's showbiz

Fade out.

int. comedy theater lobby - day #10#

Danny is hanging out at the theater, and Shawn enters.

DANNY
Shawny! Back from L.A. already? I was just getting ready to leave.

SHAWN
I never left.

DANNY
What happened?

SHAWN
My plane ticket was cancelled somehow.

DANNY
Well can you reschedule? Get another flight?

SHAWN
No flights. No rescheduling. This was it.

Danny sighs. There is a moment of pause between them.

DANNY
Take mine.

SHAWN
You want me to--?

DANNY
Take my slot. Take my plane ticket.

SHAWN
Danny. I can't do that. What about you?

DANNY
(wistful)
I was never...
(accepting)
I'm good here. This is where I belong. And you...

Danny looks at Shawn, feeling a strange cocktail of emotions - love, fear, pride, longing, confusion.

SHAWN
I'm nothing.

DANNY
(quietly)
You're everything.

SHAWN
What was that?

DANNY
You're everything to me.

SHAWN
Danny, shut up. Don't say that. I'm not anything to anyone.

DANNY
(exasperated)
Shawn, you shut up. Listen.

**[SONG 10: THE BEST OF ALL TIME (REPRISE)]**

===

>_SONG 10: THE BEST OF ALL TIME (REPRISE)_<

Danny sings directly to Shawn.

!    DANNY
~Shawn, you have got
~To build some self-worth of your own
~I've been trying to help you
~But I can't do it alone

~No one else gives you your value
~You've gotta find it within
~So I'll just say this once
~And then I won't say it again

~Shawn, I adore you
~Shawn, I'd do anything for you
~Shawn, I put no one before you
~Shawn, you're the best of all time

Shawn looks at Danny expectantly.

DANNY (CONT'D)
Now go!

Shawn nods, kisses Danny on the cheek, and runs off.

int. hollywood office - day #11#

It's the end of the day. Everett, Phyllis, and Jesse are starting to pack up.

EVERETT
We should just call it a day. No use waiting.

PHYLLIS
I suppose you're right. We--

Shawn bursts through the door.

SHAWN
I'm here... to audition... for Chuckle Plus.

Everett looks down at the folder in front of them.

EVERETT
Are you Danny? You don't look like...

PHYLLIS
No, this is Shawn.

SHAWN
Please, I... just... elevator... broken... stairs? ... please...

EVERETT
I'm sorry, we already found our guy. I want to go home. Family Feud is on in five minutes.

SHAWN
I need to do this. Please.

Shawn looks at Phyllis.

PHYLLIS
(to Everett)
Please. This could be the one.

EVERETT
Alright, but this better be good. And QUICK. I will NOT miss Family Feud.

PHYLLIS
Can't you just stream it on-demand?

EVERETT
I like to watch it live.

PHYLLIS
But isn't it just reruns at this point?

EVERETT
I like to watch the reruns live.

JESSE
Have you seen those TikToks with the hamsters dressed as Steve Harvey?

EVERETT
No, but that sounds adorable. You know, Steve Harvey is from Cleveland.

JESSE
No way! Cleveland really does have some--

PHYLLIS
Okay, shouldn't we...?

EVERETT
Right! Let's get a move on.

Jesse sets up the camera to make sure it's ready to record the audition.

JESSE
Just go ahead and slate with your name and what you'll be performing for us.

Shawn takes a deep breath and calms down a bit. As they speak, a spotlight begins to appear and the rest of the stage fades into darkness. Music begins softly and builds until the singing starts.

SHAWN
My name is Shawn Carpenter, and I'll be... I'll be doing a character called...

Shawn takes a deep breath.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
"Guy Who Just Flew For Several Hours On A Spirit Airlines Flight And Then Sprinted Up Seventeen Flights Of Stairs To Get To A Callback For What Could Be His Big Break But He's Super Nervous And Worried That His Bit Will Be Too Experimental And He's Kind Of Generally Overwhelmed By Emotion As He Attempts To Separate Himself From His Hopelessly Fragile Ego And Reconnect To The Joy He Initially Sought To Bring Through His Performance, Trying To Recapture That Feeling, That Feeling Of Pure Comedy Brought About From The Purest Form Of Love: Grief, Like That Barenaked Ladies Song That Has That Line About Laughing At A Funeral, That Feeling When You've Got The Giggles Because Your Brother Just Accidentally Drank Holy Water And You're Supposed To Be Sad Because Your Dad Just Died But You And Your Brother Can't Stop Giggling And Your Mom Gives You A Stern Look But You Can Tell She's Fighting Back A Smile Too And You See The Whole Pew Trying To Hold It In, Your Sister And Your Nephews And Your Uncle, Even Your Sister-In-Law Who Is Known For Her Severe Demeanor, And You Think About Your Dad, And You Know You're Supposed To Be Sad And You ARE Sad But Somehow The Sadness Makes It Even Funnier And Now You're Fully Cracking Up And You're Crying, Not In Spite Of The Laughter But Because Of It, Because The Funniness Makes It Even Sadder Because You Know He Would Have Found It Funny Too, And You Think About All The Years You Had With Him That Seemed To Go By In An Instant, In One Single Instant, And You Miss Him And You Love Him And Also The Priest Is Starting To Look Pretty Angry So You're Really Trying To Keep It Together But It's Just So Funny Because It Comes From The Deepest Part Of You That Feeling, That Feeling, That Is The Feeling That This Poor Guy Is Somehow Going To Try To Bring To His Audition, And He's Looking At The Panel And He Thinks About All The Other Comedians They've Already Seen Who Are Probably Funnier And More Marketable Than Him, And He Knows He Might Not Be Good Enough, But He Realizes That He's... Content, Because All He Really Wants To Do Is To Put This On Stage, To Give People A Chance To See It, To Make Them Understand, To Make... Them...

**[SONG 11: LAUGH & LIVE & LOVE]**

===

>_SONG 11: LIVE & LAUGH & LOVE_<

Shawn sings to the audience - the real audience. Phyllis, Jesse, and Everett sit quietly and watch.

!    SHAWN (CONT'D)
~Laugh a little more
~Louder than before
~Saddled by the weight of time progressing
~Every stupid moment is a blessing

~Funny 'cause it's true
~All there is to do
~In the face of existential nonsense
~Is to sop it up before it's gone and...

~Laugh and live and love
~All of the above
~Feel as deep as feelings can be feeling
~Feel it from the floor up to the ceiling

~Love and live and laugh
~Half and half and half
~Greater than the sum of each component
~Somewhere in the sum of every moment

~There's an experience he's desperate to explain
~It's more than one small dumb audition can contain
~It's everything, it's life, it's silly, it's profound
~In grave absurdity, there's meaning to be found

~Reaching out his hand
~Hopes they understand
~He is not expecting adulation
~All he really wants to do is make them...

~Laugh and maybe cry
~Both at the same time
~He has got to make it happen some way
~Also he's a mime and so he can't say

~Words"

Right after Shawn finishes singing, Jesse marks with the clapboard thing.

JESSE
Marker.

The music continues. Shawn looks down for a second, then mimes being trapped in a box in a funny but serious way. The music concludes, and Shawn steps out of character. Everett stands up and looks at Phyllis.

int. comedy theater stage - night #12#

Transition to ten years later. There could be some sort of interlude that indicates time passing and things happening. There is a calendar that says the year "2035" or whatever. The stage is decorated for Christmas - it's a "Home for the Holidays" type of show. Kieran is setting things up. Shawn enters.

KIERAN
Oh my God. Shawn Carpenter! *THE* Shawn Carpenter!

SHAWN
Hey Kieran.

KIERAN
Oh my God. You remember me!

SHAWN
Of course! It's only been what, ten years since I moved to L.A., right?

Kieran thinks for a moment.

KIERAN
I guess it has. I've been a fan of yours ever since your Chuckle Plus debut. *Melonchol-medy* is still one of my favorite shows.

SHAWN
Aww, thanks. So, what, am I here early? Where is everybody?

KIERAN
They'll be here. You know, I wasn't sure if you'd actually show!

SHAWN
I wouldn't miss it. How are the classes coming?

KIERAN
Well, I'm up to level four now... and I LOVE teaching.

SHAWN
You always had the relentless enthusiasm for it.

Mel enters.

MEL
Hey, Shawn! I guess I should act starstruck.

SHAWN
Nah, you taught me everything I know.

MEL
And yet, you didn't thank me during your Oscars speech.

SHAWN
You got your thanks during my Grammys speech.

MEL
Pshh. Grammys.

Casey enters.

CASEY
Shawn!

SHAWN
Hey, Case.

CASEY
Hey, big star like you, you want a drink on the house?

SHAWN
Sure. What can I get?

CASEY
Anything you like! As long as you still like High Life.

SHAWN
Sure, I do.

CASEY
Coming right up.

Casey goes back to the bar area.

SHAWN
The place is looking great, Mel. Better than ever.

MEL
Thanks. It's a labor of love.

Casey returns with a High Life and hands it to Shawn.

CASEY
Here ya go, kid.

SHAWN
Perfect. Hey, you happen to know what the Cavs score is?

CASEY
Give me one second.

Casey pulls out their phone. Shawn looks over at it.

SHAWN
You just googled the word "basketball" didn't you?

CASEY
Look, it knows exactly what I mean! Cavs are up 49 to 40. See, it works for me!

SHAWN
Love it. Some things never change.

MEL
It sure is great having you back in town. You know, this gives me an idea...

SHAWN
Another show pitch?

MEL
Yeah! A "Cleveland Homecoming" type of show where folks who have left us come back and perform here again.

KIERAN
Mel, that is literally what tonight's show is.

CASEY
You've officially come full circle and pitched every single possible show.

MEL
There will always be more shows to pitch. What about... a show where a... lizard... uh...

SHAWN
I've missed you guys.

MEL
We've missed you too.

SHAWN
Hey, have you heard from Vic at all?

CASEY
Vic? They are SO cancelled. Which means they host a very successful stand-up podcast.

SHAWN
Well, all the best to them.

CASEY
Still nice as ever. Guess you can take the kid out of the midwest, but you can't take the midwest out of the kid, huh?

SHAWN
Oh, that reminds me. Chuckle Plus is doing a new show called Midwest Battle Rap. It's sort of like a reverse battle, where--

MEL
Where instead of insults they compliment each other?

SHAWN
That's it!

MEL
I had the exact same idea.

CASEY
You did.

MEL
I was this close to getting it produced too. Well, now it'll get to shine with you as the star!

SHAWN
I'm not a star. I'm the same person I always was. Just got some perspective. All thanks to...

Shawn looks off into the distance and sees Danny. Danny hops onto the stage.

MEL
Hey, Danny!

DANNY
(to Shawn)
Well, well, well. If it isn't the prodigal non-binary child.

SHAWN
Well, well, well. If it isn't the non-prodigal slightly older child.

DANNY
I don't think you know what "prodigal" means.

SHAWN
I don't think it means anything. It's like one of those made-up words.

DANNY
Sure, one of those made-up words.

SHAWN
Hi Danny.

DANNY
Hi Shawn.

Danny and Shawn hug.

SHAWN
It's good to be back. So, how've things--

KIERAN
Alright, come on. Show's starting. Get off!

Everybody jumps off to the side of the stage, except for Kieran. A spotlight shines on the main microphone.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
Good evening everybody! Thanks so much for coming out tonight. Couple of housekeeping items... please silence your cell phones and refrain from flash photography (unless something really funny happens).

SHAWN
(whispered to Danny)
That bit's still in the intro script, huh?

DANNY
I know, sad, right?

SHAWN
No. I love it.

KIERAN
Bathrooms are to your left, and the bar is to your right.

**[SONG 12: ALT COMEDY THEATER (REPRISE)]**

====

>_SONG 12: ALT COMEDY THEATER (REPRISE)_<

This song begins the same way the opener does, with just one person on stage (though it is Kieran this time). Everyone else should be close to the stage.

!    KIERAN
~Get a drink at the bar
~The bartender knows your order by heart

Just off-stage but visible, Casey hands a Miller High Life to Shawn.

!     KIERAN (CONT'D)
~Livin' the High Life on Lorain Avenue
~Every weekend night and sometimes weeknights too

Shawn jumps up on stage.

!    SHAWN
~I feel at home when I'm here
~Drinkin' the champagne of beers
~All my old friends welcoming me
~And there's nowhere else I'd rather be

Every cast member gets up on stage.

~Alt comedy theater
~In a mid-size rust-belt city
~Guaranteed a whole boatload of laughs
~If you're here, you'll be feeling giddy

~Alt comedy theater
~We hope you enjoyed the show

~And raise your hand if there's someone up here
~In the cast whom you personally know

At the end of the song, the ensemble shouts "CALLBACK!" and the lights black out in time.

>_THE END_<
