int. comedy theater stage - night

The stage is set up for a normal improv show. There is a spotlight shining on the main microphone. MEL (early 40s, flustered) takes the stage. SHAWN (mid 20s, bright-eyed), DANNY (early 30s, chill), VIC (early 20s, focused), other IMPROVISERS (varied), CASEY (late 30s, tired), and KIERAN (late teens, excited) are standing in the audience area.

MEL
Good evening everybody! Thanks so much for coming out to our humble little theater on this beautiful Cleveland night. We have a great show coming up for you, but first, I have to go over some housekeeping items. Please silence your cell phones and refrain from flash photography (unless something really funny happens). Uh, make sure to clap and laugh if the show is good - actually you should do that even if you don't think it's good (it will make them feel better). You all know all this stuff. Bathrooms are to your left, and the bar is to your right.

**[SONG 1: ALT COMEDY THEATER]**

</a>

Lights black out in time with the music as the song ends. Mel comes back on stage and the house lights come up.

MEL
And that's our show! Go to our website "altcomedy.biz" for information about all our upcoming shows and workshops. And please hang out and grab another drink. Have a good night! 

Light music starts playing and there is chatter in the crowd. People mingle on the stage, including Shawn and Danny.

DANNY
Hey, great set.

SHAWN
Thanks, you too.

DANNY
Really solid object work. I mean I truly believed there was a trash can with a flip lid out there.

SHAWN
Yeah? I wasn't sure if anyone got that.

DANNY
Well it helped that you said it out loud.

SHAWN
Hey, I know the rules, and therefore, I can break them.

DANNY
You are really good at that.

SHAWN
Good at what, you mean?

DANNY
You are good at not being conventionally good.

SHAWN
Not sure if that's a compliment or not, but I'll take it. At least I know I'm better than you.

Shawn looks over at Mel and grabs their attention.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Right Mel?

MEL
What's that?

SHAWN
I'm better than Danny at improv, right?

MEL
Oh, well, I don't like to give feedback off-the-cuff like this. And really, it's completely subjective.

SHAWN
But...?

MEL
Well, you're certainly more unique...

SHAWN
And...?

MEL
I guess in a non-traditional way...

SHAWN
Right.

MEL
Sure, you're better than Danny. 

SHAWN
I knew I was your favorite.

DANNY
Careful there, Shawn. Your "Former Gifted Kid" syndrome is showing.

Vic struts past them.

DANNY (CONT'D)
And hey, speaking of former gifted kids. Great job tonight, Vic.

VIC
I do the best I can with what I'm given.

SHAWN
What's that supposed to mean?

VIC
Oh, nothing. We can talk about it later. I gotta go.

Vic walks off-stage.

DANNY
I swear, that kid is the most serious comedian I have ever met.

MEL
Is that a bad thing?

DANNY
No. I don't know.

Kieran sheepishly approaches the stage.

KIERAN
Hi, I'm Kieran. I just wanted to say you are amazing, that was so funny.

DANNY
Why thank you! I don't think I've seen you around before, you taking a class or something?

KIERAN
Yep, just about to finish Level One. I started doing stand-up way back when (almost six months ago), but I LOVE improv.

DANNY
Well stick with it. Hope to see you up here someday.

KIERAN
That would be an honor.

SHAWN
It's really not th-

KIERAN
To grace this stage... that would be a dream come true.

SHAWN
I feel like you should set your sights a little higher.

KIERAN
Oh, I don't know, I think this is great.

SHAWN
I'm going to get another drink.

Shawn departs. Chatter continues, time passes. The night goes on.

int. comedy theater stage - night

Later that very night. The stage is empty except for Shawn (sitting on a chair) and Danny. Casey peeks through the lobby door.

CASEY
Hey guys, last call before I kick you outta here.

DANNY
Yeah, we're about to get going. Come on, Shawn.

Shawn stumbles a little bit trying to stand up.

SHAWN
I don't - you know what - 

DANNY
Hey, you alright?

SHAWN
I'm fine.

DANNY
Then why do you look utterly devastated right now?

SHAWN
No, I'm good.

DANNY
You had a good show, you made fifteen whole dollars, and I even saw Casey making eyes at you from behind the bar. It was a fun night!

Shawn sits back down.

SHAWN
A good show. Not a great show.

DANNY
It was good! It was really good!

SHAWN
But it wasn't *great*. I could have been better.

DANNY
Come on, don't give me that.

Danny gets down on a knee to be at Shawn's level.

DANNY (CONT'D)
You gotta learn to love yourself more.

SHAWN
That's not going to make me any better at comedy.

DANNY
That's not the point! Don't you want to be happier?

SHAWN
I'd rather hate myself and be great than love myself and be mid.

Danny stands back up, exasperated.

DANNY
Oof, that is not healthy Shawn. Did you get that promo code for BetterHelp I sent you?

SHAWN
The one you got from the Slugslop Fatboys Podcast?

Danny shakes his head because it's irrelevant where he got the promo code.

DANNY
Did you use it?

SHAWN
Yeah. I did a live messaging session.

DANNY
How did it go?

SHAWN
Apparently I'm supposed to have gratitude for my stupid wonderful intricate life.

DANNY
That sounds reasonable.

SHAWN
I have gratitude! I do! I just... I want more. I wanted tonight to be better.

Danny begins to pace around the stage while Shawn continues to sit there.

DANNY
What did you expect? That you'd have a performance so earth-shatteringly good that by the end, in hysterical fits of laughter, the entire audience would give you a ten minute standing ovation?

SHAWN
I mean...

DANNY
That they would tell all their friends, including everyone you went to high school with, that you are spectacular and fabulous and terrific beyond measure? And that you would gain five hundred thousand Instagram followers overnight because someone had secretly recorded your set and posted it to Reels and it went viral?

SHAWN
That would be cool.

DANNY
And that that would, in turn, lead to a lifelong career in entertainment more successful than that of Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© combined? Is that what you expected? Is it?!

SHAWN
I mean, kinda, yeah. Some little part of me always expects that.

DANNY
Exactly that, all that that I just said?

SHAWN
Something like that. Something unfathomably, impossibly good.

Shawn stands up.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
That's what I want.

DANNY
Oh, Shawn.

<a href="./songs/Song02TheBestOfAllTime.html">

**[SONG 2: THE BEST OF ALL TIME]**

</a>

A moment of pause. Shawn weeps softly, and Danny comforts them. Casey opens the door again.

CASEY
Alright, you really gotta go. I want to go home.

DANNY
Give us a minute!

int. hollywood office - day

Phyllis (30s, businessy) is pacing around the room, talking on the phone. JESSE (20s, businessy) sits at a desk and stays quiet.

PHYLLIS
(on phone)
Alright, but--
Yes, I know, and I will, I just--
No, of course not. I just think--
(deep breath)
Okay. I understand.

JESSE
Bad news?

PHYLLIS
Is there any other kind?

JESSE
We're not...

PHYLLIS
No, no. Not yet.

JESSE
What is it then?

PHYLLIS
Well, you know how we have quarterly viewership targets?

JESSE
And how we always fall short of them by a large margin?

PHYLLIS
Right. Well, last quarter... let's just say it's looking worse than usual. It's looking existentially bad.

JESSE
As in...

PHYLLIS
As in this company may cease to exist if we don't do something before Q3.

JESSE
No! A streaming service exclusively for comedy nerds is an evergreen business model! Chuckle Plus can never die.

PHYLLIS
I'm afraid it might. Unless we do something bold. We need something big. Everett wants us to cast a wider net, so to speak.

JESSE
What does that mean?

PHYLLIS
The casting directors are being sent to different cities around the country. It's kind of a Hail Mary. We have to find someone really spectacular. And if we don't...

JESSE
Then...

PHYLLIS
Yep.

JESSE
So where are we going?

PHYLLIS
Well...
(deep sigh)
We're going to Cleveland.

JESSE
Cleveland, OHIO?

PHYLLIS
Apparently Everett has some connection. I know it doesn't sound good on paper, but... I believe in us. We were born to do this.

Jesse looks hesitant.

JESSE
I mean, I think I was born to make viral TikToks about the emergent psychology of earthworms, but...

PHYLLIS
But nothing! We have a chance here to do something truly special. To discover someone with the power to turn our little online video outfit into a juggernaut of entertainment.

JESSE
And we're going to find that someone in Cleveland?

PHYLLIS
At least we're not going to Youngstown.

JESSE
Hey! My glue-addicted step-cousin is from Youngstown.

PHYLLIS
Yes, Jesse. Everyone has a glue-addicted step-cousin from Youngstown. Cleveland is different. Cleveland... rocks! Drew Carey!

JESSE
(nodding)
Drew Carey. I guess the Mistake on the Lake's not so bad.

PHYLLIS
It's our only hope. If we don't find someone there... that's it for us.

<a href="./songs/Song03Cleveland.html">

**[SONG 3: CLEVELAND]**

</a>

PHYLLIS
Pack your bags, Jesse. The forest city awaits.

int. comedy theater class space - day

Back in Cleveland. An improv class is taking place, led by Mel. Danny, Shawn, Vic, and some other improvisers are present. Some of them have notebooks and pens. Other notebooks and bags are on the floor.

MEL
Two more up. Your location is... uh... a drawing room.

Shawn and Vic take the stage. Vic sits down facing away from Shawn and leafs through an imaginary book.

VIC
One.

SHAWN
Two.

Vic slams the invisible book shut and stands up. Shawn twists an imaginary ring on their finger. Vic turns to face Shawn.

VIC
Three.

SHAWN
Four.

Vic throws the book down.

VIC
Five!

Shawn looks at the book on the floor, and starts rifling through imaginary drawers, pulling things out and throwing them around.

SHAWN
Six!

Vic faces Shawn with their back to the audience of other class students.

VIC
Seven!

MEL
Remember to cheat out.

Vic adjusts to face the audience, while still looking at Shawn.

SHAWN
Eight!

They rush toward each other, their faces separated by barely an inch of air. They hold the position, gazing into each other's eyes with intensity. After a few seconds, they turn away from each other in perfect synchronization. Vic slumps to the floor, facing away from Shawn, and begins to weep.

VIC
Nine.

Shawn unsheaths a giant imaginary sword, then kneels down next to Vic and mimes stabbing them in the back emotionally.

SHAWN
(through tears)
Ten.

Vic falls over fake dead, and Shawn sits there still. After a second, Mel starts clapping weakly, and the rest of the students sort of do too.

MEL
Alright, thank you, thank you. So what do we think was going on in that scene?

SHAWN
I was thinking "Scorned Lover Gets Revenge."

VIC
I thought we were brothers.

DANNY
Maybe both.

VIC
Gross.

Mel takes a look at their watch.

MEL
Well, on that note, class is over! The next class will be here any minute so we gotta get outta here. See you all next week, great job today everyone.

The improv students start to pack up their belongings and start to chatter.

DANNY
Your scenes with Vic always seem to get so dark. What's up with that? You... you good?

SHAWN
Yeah I'm fine. It's just that my philosophy is that good comedy should not be funny.

DANNY
I think that's just straight up incorrect.

SHAWN
No, you see, it's absurd, and it is humorous, but not-- I can't explain it.

Danny, Shawn, and Vic head for the door. Kieran is on the other side, about to enter.

MEL
One last thing: someone from Chuckle Plus is going to be here this weekend holding local auditions. They're casting some new show, I don't know much about it.

Vic turns to face Mel.

VIC
Wait. *THE* Chuckle Plus?

MEL
The one and only Chuckle Plus. They're looking for characters, impressions, sketches, anything. So get your packets ready and start running lines.

Mel starts putting up a sign on the class bulletin board.

SHAWN
Oh wow.

DANNY
Wow.

KIERAN
Wow.

VIC
Wow.

SHAWN
This... this is a sign.

DANNY
You mean the sign Mel's putting up that says "AUDITIONS THIS WEEKEND"?

SHAWN
Yes. Do you think they'd be up for a totally improvised audition?

DANNY
You might want to prepare a little.

VIC
I don't know. A fully improvised audition could be impressive.

DANNY
You should write something down.

SHAWN
You're right. I don't want to mess this up. This could be my destiny.

VIC
This could be *my* destiny.

DANNY
Heck, I'll throw my hat in the ring.

KIERAN
This... this could be it.

<a href="./songs/Song04ThisCouldBeIt.html">

**[SONG 4: THIS COULD BE IT]**

</a>

After the song, everybody scatters with gusto - ready to go home and prepare for the auditions.

int. comedy theater stage - day

It's the big audition day. Mel enters, leading Phyllis and Jesse behind.

MEL
You get in okay? How was the flight?

JESSE
Oh, not so bad, it was--

PHYLLIS
It was fine.

They approach the stage and Mel gestures grandly.

MEL
And here's the stage. Anything I can do to help? Anything you need?

PHYLLIS
We got it from here.

MEL
You sure? Coffee, Kirkland-brand sparkling water, anything?

PHYLLIS
We're good.

MEL
Great! I'll be in the lobby if you need anything. The performers should be arriving any minute.

Mel exits to the lobby.

PHYLLIS
Is everyone in the midwest this obnoxiously nice?

JESSE
I like it.

Phyllis and Jesse begin to setup their table and camera.

JESSE (CONT'D)
And Uber is so cheap here!

PHYLLIS
It's cheap for a reason, Jesse. I really do not have high expectations for this day.

Phyllis rubs her forehead to show that she is tired. They finish setting up.

JESSE
Key to happiness, right?

PHYLLIS
Huh?

JESSE
Low expectations, the--

PHYLLIS
(shouting)
Alright, bring 'em in!

Kieran, Vic, Shawn, Danny, and other improvisers enter and stand off to the side of the stage.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Let's get through this as quickly as possible. You each have five minutes. Up first is...

Phyllis looks at her notebook.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Kieran Allen-Johnson.

KIERAN
Wish me luck, guys!

Danny gives Kieran a big thumbs up as they step on stage.

PHYLLIS
Let's see it.

KIERAN
These are some jokes I wrote.

They pull out a notebook and read from it directly.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
What was the cat doing in the bag in the first place?

No reaction.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
If you add insult to injury you get insjultry.

No reaction, but Kieran continues unfazed. 

KIERAN (CONT'D)
If you had a bookstore that was also a farm for exclusively female cattle, it would be called Barns and No Bull.

Again, no reaction. Kieran continues telling jokes while Vic and Shawn have a side conversation.

VIC
How much more of this do we have to take?

SHAWN
I don't know, I think these are kind of funny.

Keiran has put on a pair of sunglasses and taken out a mobility cane.

KIERAN
I'm a duck hunter. Whenever I go hunting, everybody has to duck!

SHAWN
Okay that one was bad.

VIC
Well, the good news is I'll have no problem beating this sorry excuse for a comic.

DANNY
Oh come on. You should be more supportive, they're trying their best.

VIC
Their best is awful. I am so much better.

SHAWN
Why not just be the best you can be?

DANNY
Yeah, like the US Army.

Shawn ignores Danny and continues talking to Vic.

SHAWN
Why do you have to belittle others?

VIC
Comedy's a competition, Shawn.

Kieran concludes the act with a bow, and scampers off stage.

PHYLLIS
Next up, we have... Vic Nixon.

Vic steps up to the stage.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
What have you got for us, Vic?

VIC
This is a character called... me.

<a href="./songs/Song05ComedyCompetition.html">

**[SONG 5: COMEDY'S A COMPETITION]**

</a>

Phyllis applauds enthusiastically.

PHYLLIS
Wonderful! Thank you. Next is... Shawn Carpenter.

Vic steps off stage as Shawn steps up.

VIC
See if you can top that.

Shawn looks distressed. They nervously turn to face Phyllis and Jesse.

SHAWN
(Italianly)
Oh, mamma mia, the meat-a-ball! I--

Shawn cuts off.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
(normal)
I-- okay, I can't do this. New plan. I'm going to improvise something based on Vic's audition.

Phyllis looks exhausted.

PHYLLIS
Wonderful. Improv is always good. Let's hear it.

<a href="./songs/Song06ComedyReprise.html">

**[SONG 6: COMEDY'S A COMPETITION (REPRISE)]**

</a>

Shawn floats off stage.

JESSE
Wow. I have never seen Phyllis do anything like that before.

VIC
(through grit teeth)
Good job.

PHYLLIS
Bravo, bravo, bravo. Wow. Okay, next... Danny Bernadakis.

Danny steps up to the stage.

DANNY
This is a character called Boston Mark.

DANNY (CONT'D)
(Bostonly)
Hey, kid! How's your mum? You got your Dunkies? How about them Sox? Tom Brady. Tom Brady. Tom. Brady.

Phyllis is laughing heartily, her heart opened by Shawn's performance. Danny's audition continues and fades out.

int. comedy theater lobby - day

Casey, Mel, and Kieran are hanging out in the lobby.

MEL
So you literally just google the word "news" to get your news?

CASEY
I cannot think of a better way.

KIERAN
There are *only* better ways. You know Google has a news tab, right?

CASEY
I don't know, that doesn't feel right.

MEL
Just download any app.

CASEY
Eh. I don't care enough about the news.

KIERAN
Wait, let me see that.

Kieran grabs Casey's phone.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
You just google the word "weather" to get your weather?

Casey grabs their phone back.

CASEY
It works for me!

KIERAN
No wonder you never know what's going on.

MEL
Show pitch. Improv based on people's search history.

KIERAN
Oh, that's good. I would see that for sure.

CASEY
As long as you don't use mine.

Kieran pulls out their phone and begins to check it.

CASEY (CONT'D)
I don't need to be on blast like that. I search for some pretty out there stuff.

Kieran's eyes widen.

KIERAN
Hold on. Guys. Guys. I just got an email from Chuckle Plus.

MEL
Ooh, what does it say?

KIERAN
I didn't open it! Too scared.

CASEY
Come on, open it.

KIERAN
Okay.

Kieran closes their eyes and takes a deep breath. They squint open one eye. They begin frantically reading the email, their expression slowly turning into a frown.

MEL
Bad news?

KIERAN
I didn't get it.

CASEY
Tough luck, kid. You're young though, you'll have plenty more chances.

KIERAN
Sure, I... I gotta go

They hold back tears as they exit.

MEL
Oof. That first big rejection always hurts, doesn't it.

CASEY
Sure does. They all do. Until they don't.

MEL
Here's to that.

Mel and Casey clink their bottles.

MEL (CONT'D)
Anyway, show pitch - drunk improv. What do you--

Danny and Shawn enter, continuing a conversation.

SHAWN
No way. 150 gallons of breastmilk?

DANNY
I'm telling you. At *least* 150 gallons. Every day. And it's like toothpaste.

SHAWN
You have got to stop spending all your time on whale fact TiKTok.

DANNY
TikTok? No. I get all my whale facts from "whalefacts.org".

SHAWN
Yeah I guess that tracks. Hey Casey. Hey Mel.

Everybody greets each other.

CASEY
So, did you check your emails?

SHAWN
Emails?

MEL
Kieran just got an email from Chuckle Plus.

Shawn's face is flush with excitement and nervousness. They shakily pull out their phone.

SHAWN
Oh my God.

DANNY
What is it?

SHAWN
I got a callback.

DANNY
That's great!

MEL
Congratulations.

CASEY
Well deserved.

SHAWN
Yeah, I... I can't do it.

MEL
Why not?

Danny checks his phone as well, and sees that he also got a callback.

DANNY
Yeah, why not? I'll be there. Look at this!

Danny shows Shawn his phone.

SHAWN
That's... yay!

CASEY
Congrats, Danny. It'll be great, the two of you out there in Hollyworld. You gotta go, Shawn.

SHAWN
I'm not sure. I really can't miss another day of work.

DANNY
Work shmurk. What happened to "I wanna be the very best like no one ever was?"

SHAWN
That was just a pipe dream. This is real. I can't afford an actual plane ticket.

MEL
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Shawn. You gotta do it.

CASEY
Trust me. This is rare.

SHAWN
They probably just sent this email to me by accident.

DANNY
Again with this. You saw how Phyllis reacted to your performance. They want you.

SHAWN
No, it was too weird and not funny enough. She liked it, but I don't think the CEO of Chuckle Plus is going to like it. I'm too weird.

MEL
You're unique!

SHAWN
I'll just embarrass myself and it will all be for nothing.

CASEY
Okay, worst case, yes. It goes terribly, terribly wrong.

DANNY
Sure.

CASEY
Like, really horrendously, tragically wrong.

DANNY
Okay, that's enough. Even if it does go terribly, terribly wrong. It's worth it to try.

SHAWN
I can't do this.

DANNY
Listen. If anyone can do this, it's you.

<a href="./songs/Song07IfAnyoneCanDoThis.html">

**[SONG 7: IF ANYONE CAN DO THIS]**

</a>

SHAWN
Alright, I guess I have to do this.

DANNY
That's the spirit.

int. comedy theater stage - night

Vic is alone on stage, nervously pacing back and forth, refreshing their phone.

VIC
Come on, come on...

They refresh their phone again, and see a new email appear. They quickly scan it.

VIC (CONT'D)
Yes! I knew it. Yes, yes, yes!

They continue pacing, now more excited.

VIC (CONT'D)
Okay. I got this. Smooth sailing from here. As long as... well, there's really only one person who could beat me. If they don't make it, I'll be good. If they do... I'll figure it out. I just really hope they didn't give a callback to...

Shawn enters. Vic's demeanor changes to an overly-exuberant facade of friendliness.

VIC (CONT'D)
Shawn! Hey buddy.

SHAWN
Hey Vic. You're here early.

VIC
Oh, you know me. Punctuality is my only vice.

SHAWN
Oh yeah. Mine's ice cream.

VIC
Hahaha, you're so funny.

SHAWN
Thanks. Hey, speaking of that, did you...

VIC
Did I what?

SHAWN
Chuckle Plus callbacks. Did you...

VIC
Oh, of course! Yes, I just got the email. And I'm sure you got one too?

SHAWN
Yep, somehow I did.

Vic's facade of joy breaks a little bit.

VIC
And you're planning to go?

SHAWN
Danny convinced me.

VIC
Oh, wonderful! Hey, I've got an idea. Let me book our flight. I'm a rewards member for every airline, I can get us a great deal.

SHAWN
Yeah, I guess that could--

VIC
We can sit together! It will be so fun!

SHAWN
Alright, sure.

VIC
Great. I'll do it right now. You can pay me back whenever.

SHAWN
Okay, I guess that's...

Vic pulls out their phone again and quickly taps away at a flight booking website.

VIC
Done! I just forwarded you the confirmation email.

Shawn pulls out their phone to check.

SHAWN
That was really fast.

VIC
That's my other vice.

SHAWN
Ha, yeah. Well, thanks. What a whirlwind. How much was--

VIC
Oh, don't worry about it. We'll sort all that out later. You just get ready for the big audition.

SHAWN
Yeah, you too!

VIC
May the best comedian win.

SHAWN
Right.

Shawn departs, leaving Vic alone on stage again. Vic sneers menacingly, and begins to laugh. They put their fingers together like Mr. Burns.

VIC
Yes, yes. The "best" comedian. Ha ha ha. I'll make sure there's only one "best" comedian. Ha ha ha.

<a href="./songs/Song08BadBadBaddie.html">

**[SONG 8: BAD BAD BADDIE]**

</a>

VIC
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Vic takes out their phone, dials it, and puts it to their ear.

VIC
Hi, I recently booked two tickets for a flight, and I'd like to cancel one of them. Ha ha ha. No sorry I'm just laughing maniacally. Ha ha ha ha-- yes I'll hold. Ha ha ha ha ha!

>_ACT TWO_<

int. airport - day

It's early in the morning at the airport. TINA (older, severe) sits at a boarding pass booth while Shawn waits in line.

TINA
Next.

Shawn approaches.

SHAWN
Hi! Beautiful morning, huh?

TINA
I.D. and boarding pass.

SHAWN
Sure thing!

Shawn takes out their ID and their phone with the boarding pass. Tina scans it.

TINA
It's not going through.

SHAWN
What's that? Oh, let me turn my brightness up...

TINA
It's not your brightness. Your ticket was cancelled.

SHAWN
It was-- what? No.

TINA
I'm sorry. Next!

SHAWN
Wait, I--

Tina looks at him stone-faced.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Can I get another ticket?

TINA
You can try customer service. But good luck finding another flight to LAX this weekend.

SHAWN
Okay, can you just--

TINA
Next!

SHAWN
Please, just-- I need to get there today, they're not going to hold my spot--

TINA
That is not my problem. You're holding up the line. Next!

Shawn's frustration bubbles over. Midwest emo music begins as he rants.

SHAWN
Please just have one tiny modicum of empathy for me here!

TINA
Excuse me?

SHAWN
I'm sorry, I know, I'm sure your job is a lot and I don't mean to take my frustration out on you but can you just feel something, can you try to understand! Sometimes it feels like the entire universe is against me, this is the most pivotal moment of my life and I'm just so-- it's like I'm on a rollercoaster and I have whiplash and I-- and you are so mad at me just for existing, and again, I know, this does not look like a fun job and I'm sure emotional labor is draining but do you see that I'm another person here, my whole life I have been trying to express myself and connect and relate and I just never can, and you will never understand me, and I just--

Shawn begins to sing, and Tina looks even more exhausted.

<a href="./songs/Song09Tired.html">

**[SONG 9: I'M SO TIRED]**

</a>

By the end of the song, Tina has been moved (ever so slightly).

TINA
I'm sorry, honey. Next!

int. hollywood office - day

Vic is on the makeshift stage, just finishing up an audition in front of EVERETT (40s, gravitous), Phyllis, and Jesse.

VIC
This is my destiny
They'll be obsessed with me
If you're in the same room as me
You're blessed to be
No one can jest like me
There's no one left to see
You can forget about the rest
Because the best is me
I'm the best

Vic bows. Everett applauds enthusiastically.

EVERETT
Splendid. Really, really good.
(to Phyllis)
See? I told you Cleveland had talent.

PHYLLIS
You were right. Just wait. You can go now, Vic.

EVERETT
We'll be in touch.

VIC
Thank you so much, it was a privilege.

Vic slowly starts to walk away, but lingers in the room.

PHYLLIS
Okay, our next performer... ah yes. Shawn.

Phyllis smiles widely.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
(to Jesse)
Can you--

JESSE
Yes, well - apparently Shawn isn't here yet.

Vic sneers.

VIC
Oh, yes, unfortunate. I think there might have been some sort of mix-up with the airline.

PHYLLIS
Oh, no. I really think... well... shoot.

EVERETT
We're on a schedule here. If Shawn couldn't be here on time, that's it.

PHYLLIS
Well, maybe...

EVERETT
No second chances. Besides, we have an... *excellent* pool of candidates already.

Everett winks at Vic.

PHYLLIS
Of course.

Vic is still standing there, kind of awkwardly smiling and trying to not seem evil.

PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
Okay, seriously Vic, you can go now.

int. comedy theater lobby - day

Danny is hanging out at the theater, and Shawn enters.

DANNY
Shawny! Back from LA already? I was just getting ready to leave.

SHAWN
I never left.

DANNY
What happened?

SHAWN
My plane ticket was cancelled somehow.

DANNY
You think Vic--

SHAWN
I don't know. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

DANNY
Well can you reschedule? Get another flight?

SHAWN
No flights. No rescheduling. This was it.

Danny sighs.

DANNY
Take mine.

SHAWN
What?

DANNY
Take my slot. Take my plane ticket.

SHAWN
Danny. I can't do that. What about you?

DANNY
I don't need it. I'm happy here. Besides, they don't really want someone like me.

SHAWN
But if I go, and I don't get it... I don't want to throw away your shot.

DANNY
It doesn't matter if you don't get it. Don't do it for them. Do it for you. You've got something here.

SHAWN
No, I'm the--

DANNY
No! Listen.

SHAWN
You really think that?

DANNY
I don't know, but you're the best *friend* of all time.

SHAWN
Oh, Danny, no, you are.

DANNY
You are.

SHAWN
You are.

DANNY
Okay we don't have time for this. My-- *your* flight leaves in forty minutes! You have to go. Now!

int. hollywood office - day

Everett, Phyllis, and Jesse are hanging out in between auditions.

EVERETT
Oof. That one was rough.

PHYLLIS
I don't know, I thought it was--

EVERETT
Of course you liked it. But it wasn't marketable.

Phyllis complete's Everett's sentence.

PHYLLIS
Marketable, I know. I know.

EVERETT
We need people who are TikTokable. People like... what was that one named? Vic?

PHYLLIS
Vic Nixon.

EVERETT
Right! People like Vic. You should be ecstatic! Vic was your pick!

PHYLLIS
Vic was *one* of my picks.

EVERETT
You did it! Vic could be the savior this company needs, and *you* found them. Isn't that what you wanted?

PHYLLIS
That's what I thought, but... what about the art? What about truly, deeply moving performances? When did it become all about the business? Show business, it's... Jesse, help me out here, how did I articulate this?

JESSE
Right. You said "We toil at the mercy of..."

PHYLLIS
Oh yeah. I remember.

<a href="./songs/Song11Showbiz.html">

**[SONG 11: THAT'S SHOWBIZ]**

</a>

EVERETT
That is showbiz, you know. It's not called "showcharity" is it?

PHYLLIS
No.

EVERETT
Vic is the best for business. For someone to beat Vic, their performance would have to be... metamorphic.

PHYLLIS
You're right. It's not going to happen.

int. airport - day

Tina is in the TSA check-in booth. Shawn enters.

TINA
You again? My luck.

SHAWN
I triple checked this time. My friend transferred their ticket to me. My boarding pass is all good to go.

Shawn hands over the boarding pass/phone and ID.

TINA
It's not scanning.

Shawn panics for a second.

SHAWN
No, no, um... check the brightness...

Shawn grabs the phone and turns the brightness up.

TINA
Alright, it went through. You're all set.

SHAWN
Phew. I was about to have a heart attack.

Tina is still mostly stone-faced, but has a glint of lightheartedness.

TINA
As long as I don't have to listen to another rant from you.

SHAWN
Oh, I really am so sorry about that, really, I...

TINA
It's alright. Go get 'em, honey.

SHAWN
Thanks. Thank you.

Shawn rushes off onto the jetway.

int. hollywood office - day

Everett, Phyllis, and Jesse are waiting for Danny to show up. They're sitting behind the audition desk with some papers on it.

EVERETT
We should just call it a day. No use waiting.

PHYLLIS
I suppose you're right. We--

Shawn bursts through the door, chest heaving.

SHAWN
I'm here... to audition... for Chuckle Plus.

Everett looks down at the folder in front of him.

EVERETT
Are you... Danny? You don't look like--

PHYLLIS
No, this is Shawn.

SHAWN
Please, I... just... elevator... broken... stairs? ... please...

EVERETT
I don't have time for this. We already found our guy. I want to go home. Family Feud is on in five minutes.

SHAWN
I need to do this. Please.

Shawn looks at Phyllis.

PHYLLIS
(to Everett)
Please. This could be the one.

EVERETT
Alright, but this better be good. And QUICK. I will NOT miss Family Feud.

PHYLLIS
I think this will be better than Family Feud.

EVERETT
Unlikely, but okay. Let's get a move on.

Jesse sets up the camera to make sure it's ready to record the audition.

JESSE
Just go ahead slate with your name and what you'll be performing for us.

Shawn takes a deep breath and calms down a bit. As they speak, a spotlight begins to appear and the rest of the stage fades into darkness. Music begins softly and builds until the singing starts.

SHAWN
My name is Shawn Carpenter, and I'll be... I'll be doing a character called...

Shawn takes a deep breath.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
"Guy Who Just Flew For Several Hours On A Spirit Airlines Flight And Then Sprinted Up Seventeen Flights of Stairs To Get To A Callback For What Could Be His Big Break But He's Super Nervous And Worried That His Bit Will Be Too Experimental And He's Kind Of Generally Overwhelmed By Emotion As He Attempts To Separate Himself From His Hopelessly Fragile Ego And Reconnect To The Joy He Initially Sought To Bring Through His Performance, Trying Recapture That Feeling, That Feeling Of Pure Comedy Brought About From The Purest Form Of Love, Grief, Like That Barenaked Ladies Song That Has That Line About Laughing At A Funeral, That Feeling When You Can't Keep The Giggles In Your Mouth Because Your Brother Just Accidentally Drank Holy Water And You're Supposed To Be Sad Because Your Dad Just Died But You And Your Brother Can't Stop Giggling And Your Mom Gives You A Stern Look But You Can Tell She's Fighting Back A Smile Too And You See The Whole Pew Trying To Hold It In, Your Sister And Your Nephews And Your Uncle And Everybody Even Your Sister-In-Law Who Is Known For Her Severe Demeanor And You Think About Your Dad And You Know You're Supposed To Be Sad And You ARE Sad But Somehow The Sadness Makes It Even Funnier And Now You're Fully Cracking Up And You're Crying, Not In Spite Of The Laughter But Because Of It, Because The Funniness Makes It Even Sadder Because You Know He Would Have Found It Funny Too And You Think About All The Years You Had With Him That Seemed To Go By In An Instant, In One Single Instant, And You Miss Him And You Love Him But Also The Priest Looks Kind Of Mad So You're Really Trying To Keep It Together But It's Just So Funny Because It Comes From The Deepest Part Of You That Feeling, That Is The Feeling That This Poor Guy Is Somehow Going To Try To Bring To His Audition, And He's Looking At The Panel With Their Cold Business Faces And He Thinks About All The Other Comedians They've Already Seen Who Are Probably Funnier Than Him And He Just Wants To Express All Of This, Somehow Make Them Understand, Somehow Make Them Feel This Feeling, Somehow, Make... Them...

**[SONG 12: LAUGH & LIVE & LOVE]**

</a>

JESSE
Marker.

The music continues. Shawn looks down for a second, then looks up and just shrugs and does an Urkel "Did I Do That?" type of silly expression. The music concludes, and Shawn steps out of character. Everett stands up and looks at Phyllis.

int. comedy theater lobby - night

Danny, Casey, Mel and Vic are chatting. Mel is facing away from the entrance.

DANNY
So his first name has always been Michael?

MEL
Michael Caine? Yes! What else would it have been?

DANNY
I don't know, it feels like it used to be something else.

CASEY
You're messing with us.

VIC
No way you are actually this dumb.

DANNY
No, I just--

Shawn enters looking glum. Casey, Danny, and Vic stop talking.

MEL
He has been Michael Caine since at least the 60s! He's--

Mel sees the looks on their faces.

MEL (CONT'D)
What?

Mel turns around.

MEL (CONT'D)
Oh, hi Shawn.

SHAWN
Hey Mel. Casey. Danny.

Shawn pauses for a moment.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Vic.

VIC
Shawn, listen, I--

SHAWN
It's alright. It's alright. You were right. Comedy *is* a competition.

Another dramatic pause.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
And I won.

DANNY
You mean you--

SHAWN
I got it.

Danny, Mel, and Casey cheer.

DANNY
Way to go!

MEL
I knew you could do it.

CASEY
Good job, kid.

VIC
Well, I guess... the best. Comedian. Won. But this isn't over.

SHAWN
I hope not.

Vic storms off, sad and angry.

MEL
Well this is wonderful. We have to celebrate! When do you leave?

SHAWN
Tomorrow. They want me back tomorrow.

MEL
I guess we have to celebrate tonight then!

DANNY
Amazing. Incredible. Fabulous.

CASEY
I've been saving this...

Casey pulls out a Miller High Life Champagne Bottle.

MEL
Crack open that bubbly!

Casey pops the bottle and passes out champagne flutes. Shawn grabs one and holds it up for Casey.

CASEY
Okay, first, one condition. When you get back to Hollyville, you've gotta say hi to Everett for me.

SHAWN
Sure.

Casey pours the glass, and continues to pour the rest of the glasses while talking. No one drinks yet.

DANNY
What, you know him?

CASEY
Sure. We grew up together.

MEL
Wait, Everett Barrington grew up in Cleveland?

CASEY
North Collinwood, born and raised.

MEL
I feel like I should have known that.

CASEY
Why else you think Chuckle Plus would have held auditions here?

MEL
I don't know, I just thought someone there liked Mr. Hero.

DANNY
So what happened? You still stay in touch?

CASEY
Not really. After high school he got out of Ohio as fast as he could.

SHAWN
That's kind of... sad.

CASEY
It is sad. But it's alright. Things change. People leave all the time.

SHAWN
Why did he leave?

CASEY
Folks with big ambitions don't tend to stick around here long. And, well... now you're one of those folks.

There is a moment of pause, everyone reflecting on the time they've shared.

DANNY
Okay, can we drink now?

CASEY
One more thing. A toast.

They all raise their glasses.

CASEY
To my big brother George. The richest man in town.

MEL
Come on, do a real one.

CASEY
Alright, alright. To those who leave. And to those who stay.

Everybody clinks glasses.

**[SONG 13: LEAVIN' CLEVELAND]**

SHAWN
Well, speaking of leaving... I gotta go pack. I'll see you all around.

DANNY
Make us proud, Shawn.

SHAWN
I'll do my best.

Everybody waves as Shawn exits.

int. comedy theater stage - night

Ten years later. The stage is decorated for Christmas - it's a "Home for the Holidays" type of show. Kieran is setting things up. Shawn enters.

KIERAN
Oh my God. Shawn Carpenter! *THE* Shawn Carpenter!

SHAWN
Hey Kieran.

KIERAN
Oh my God. You remember me!

SHAWN
Of course. What, am I here early? Where is everybody?

KIERAN
They'll be here. Wow, I wasn't sure if you'd actually show!

SHAWN
I wouldn't miss it. How are the classes coming?

KIERAN
Well, I'm up to level four now... and I LOVE teaching.

SHAWN
You always had the relentless enthusiasm for it.

Mel enters.

MEL
Hey, Shawn! I guess I should act starstruck.

SHAWN
Nah, you taught me everything I know.

MEL
And yet, you didn't thank me during your Oscars speech.

SHAWN
You got your thanks during my Grammys speech.

MEL
Pshh. Grammys.

Casey enters.

CASEY
Shawn!

SHAWN
Hey, Case.

CASEY
Hey, big star like you, you want a drink on the house?

SHAWN
Sure. What can I get?

CASEY
Anything you like! As long as you still like High Life.

SHAWN
Sure, I do.

CASEY
Coming right up.

Casey goes back to the bar area.

SHAWN
Man, I forgot how obnoxiously nice everyone is here.

Vic enters.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Well, almost everyone.

Shawn nods respectfully.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Vic.

VIC
Shawn.

Danny enters.

DANNY
Well, well, well, if it isn't the EGO kid.

SHAWN
I'll nab that Tony one day. Full EGOT status, coming soon.

DANNY
I'm sure you will.

SHAWN
It's the hardest one.

DANNY
Sure, the hardest one.

SHAWN
Hi Danny.

DANNY
Hi Shawn.

Danny and Shawn hug.

SHAWN
It's good to be back. So, how've things--

KIERAN
Alright, come on. Show's starting. Get off!

Everybody jumps off to the side of the stage, except for Kieran. A spotlight shines on the main microphone.

KIERAN (CONT'D)
Good evening everybody! Thanks so much for coming out tonight. Couple of housekeeping items... please silence your cell phones and refrain from flash photography (unless something really funny happens).

SHAWN
(whispered to Danny)
That bit's still in the intro script, huh?

DANNY
I know, sad, right?

SHAWN
No. I love it.

KIERAN
Bathrooms are to your left, and the bar is to your right.
