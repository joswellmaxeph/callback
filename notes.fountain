
SHAWN
Listen, I just want every single person in the whole entire world to fall madly in love with me. Is that so much to ask?

DANNY
Every single person? What about just... one person?

Danny looks at Shawn like they are the only person who has ever existed.

SHAWN
Well... I guess it would depend on which one person. Like if it's Emma Stone, that might work.

Danny chuckles.

DANNY
Oh why didn't you say so! Me and Emma go way back. I'll send her an email.

SHAWN
And you'll CC me?

DANNY
And I'll CC you.

SHAWN
Thanks, Danny.

DANNY
Sure thing.
